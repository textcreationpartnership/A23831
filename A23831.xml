            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>Great SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THe gracious acceptance which your Majeſty was pleaſed to allow the firſt Volume of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the Holy Scriptures to eſtabliſh the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, encouraged and almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated me to the further preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laying theſe two Volumes at this time at your Majeſties Feet. Your Majeſty did me the honour to ſay, <hi>That you were pleaſed to ſee Divines apply themſelves to the clearing of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſo important.</hi> And after this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:46528:3"/>given by ſo great a Prince, which is ſo evident a Demonſtration of your Zeal for the Fundamental Truths of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> it had been unpardonable in me not to have gone on with the Work; and I had Reaſon then to Conſecrate it wholly to your Majeſty, who I was aſſured would approve of my Intentions, and for that Reaſon would pardon the Imperfections of the Performance. As your Majeſty continues ſtill to give ſuch illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtances of your Clemency and Royal Protection to thoſe of our Nation, ſo, I confeſs, Sir, I thought my ſelf under an Obligation to lay hold upon this Opportunity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing what all thoſe who find ſo ſure a Protection in your Majeſties Dominions, feel and think as much as my ſelf upon theſe new Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of your Royal Bounty: When
<pb facs="tcp:46528:3"/>your Majeſty had taken us into your particular care, and had granted us ſeveral Priviledges, and ſo made us ſharers in all the Advantages, which thoſe who live under your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoy, your Majeſty did yet ſomething more, and inſpired all your Subjects with the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards us with which your Royal Breaſt was already touched. You ſaw our miſeries, and reſolved to give us eaſe, and this generous Deſign was executed, and your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Clemency diffuſed in the hearts of all your Subjects. The whole World, Sir, which has received upon all its Coaſts ſome Remainders of our Shipwrack, is fill'd with admiration of the unexampled effects of your Majeſties Clemency. There is no place ſo barbarous, whither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of that mercy which has been ſo gloriouſly extended towards us,
<pb facs="tcp:46528:4"/>has not been carried: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance will be ever dear to the remoteſt Ages of Poſterity. We muſt Sir, be wholly inſenſible if we had not all of us the higheſt ſenſe of ſo great a Bounty; and we ſhould juſtly appear to the whole World to be unworthy of this your Majeſties Paternal care, if notwithſtanding that low condition to which we are now reduced, we ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelves before your Auguſt Throne with the humbleſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Thankfulneſs. When God ſhow'rs down the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon Mankind, he requires this juſt Tribute, which is alſo their greateſt honour, by opening to them an acceſs unto the Throne of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this ſacred Pattern we crave leave to follow, when we ſolemnly pay the like Tribute to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who can receive nothing from
<pb facs="tcp:46528:4"/>us again, that can anſwer the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the number of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which have ſo very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all our deſires. I could wiſh, Sir, that this Work which I now preſent to your Majeſty, might be ſo haypy as to paſs to Poſterity with this Character of our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it might ſtand as a faithful Record for ever, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the memory of that lively ſenſe of your Bounty, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on all our hearts: If this could be hoped for, it muſt be wholly owing to your Majeſties glorious Name, which lateſt Ages will receive with Reverence. But, Sir, tho' I dare not hope that theſe <hi>Reflexions</hi> can obtain that honour, yet our Age at leaſt may ſee, that they bear theſe publick Marks of Gratitude for all your Majeſties Royal Favours. This, Sir, is my ſole
<pb facs="tcp:46528:5"/>aim in the Dedication of this Work to your Majeſty; and may your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty be pleaſed to approve of theſe poor Teſtimonies of our Thankfulneſs in general, and to look upon them as Inſtances of mine in particular, and of that profound Reſpect, with which I am,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>ONe may divide Men into two general Claſſes, ſome are without any knowledge of a Diety, or Sence of Religion: Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers tell us, that in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and ſome places of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſuch people are to be found. I know this is a Fact which is diſputed by others, and <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> a Divine of the Palatinate, pretends that he has ſolidly confuted it. If this Fact ſhould be thought doubtful, yet it is known at leaſt, that ſome perſons may be found here and there in the World who look upon the Exiſtence of a Deity, as upon a Fable, and who ridicule all acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip whatſoever: But one may alſo ſay, that if he compare theſe with the reſt of the World, they make the leaſt and worſt part of Mankind, tho many of them affect to live Morally well.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46528:6"/>
                  <p>All the reſt of the World make Profeſſion that they own a God; that is to ſay, a moſt perfect, Eternal, and independent Being; that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things by his Providence; that there is a difference between Good and Evil; that Man doth well or ill in thoſe Actions which depend on his Liberty: From whence they equally conclude, that Man was deſign'd for the Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that Society without it would be pure Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: And that, as it is hard to conceive that Men ſhould be wholly deſtroy'd by Death, ſo it is directly contrary to the Sentiments of Conſcience to deny all Rewards for Virtue, or Puniſhments for Vice after this Life.</p>
                  <p>All the Diverſities of Religion amongſt Men are reducible to two kinds.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is of thoſe who ſuppoſe, that there is more than one God, and this is the Belief of all <hi>Pagans</hi> in general.</p>
                  <p>The Second is of thoſe that acknowledge one only God, ſuch are the <hi>Jews, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as for the cure of different Diſeaſes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Remedies are made uſe of, ſo it is viſible, that to deliver Men of their various prejudices, we muſt take very different Methods.</p>
                  <p>The ignorance of thoſe Barbarous People in the <hi>Indies, Tartary,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by teaching them the firſt Principles, and
<pb facs="tcp:46528:6"/>making them apply the little ſenſe they have left them of good and evil, right and wrong, to the fundamental Maxims of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Atheiſts muſt be convinced, by Reflexions upon thoſe Principles, which they admit, by ſhewing, that the Truths which they reject, are the natural Conſequences of thoſe Principles, which they dare not diſpute.</p>
                  <p>To convince the Heathen, who ſuppoſe many Gods, we muſt examine their Principles, and confute them; which is the eaſieſt thing in the World; the Wiſeſt Men having formerly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as they alſo own to this very day, that there is but one God.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it ſeems, that the greateſt part of Philoſophers did own a plurality of Gods, only in compliance with the Opinions of the people, which it was dangerous to contradict.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Jews,</hi> foraſmuch as they agree with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> about the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God, we are only to prove to them the truth of that which is the very Eſſence of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> in oppoſition to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; One may prove this againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> without any trouble, becauſe they are agreed in moſt of thoſe Principles, which the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> ſuppoſes. So likewiſe it is eaſily eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed againſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who grant the truth of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in general, but
<pb facs="tcp:46528:7"/>pretend that it ought to give place to <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm,</hi> as the Law ought to give place to the Goſpel, preach'd by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>My deſign is not to proſecute every one of theſe ways in particular. There are Books enough in the World which ſolidly prove the neceſſity of Religion againſt all ſorts of Atheiſts, as well thoſe, who are ſo through ignorance, as thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves ſuch from Love to Libertiniſm, and to paſs for Men of a mighty reach.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſeveral Famous Authors, who have made it evident, that Reaſon alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to overthrow all <hi>Pagan</hi> Religions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>I am reſolved to follow a more compendious, and ſure Method, that is, to demonſtrate the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> conſidered by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, It is impoſſible (conſidering the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there is between the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and all other Religions in the World) that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> ſhould be the true, but that all others muſt be falſe in thoſe Articles wherein they eſſentially differ from it.</p>
                  <p>And on the other hand, one cannot explain thoſe Arguments which clearly evince the truth of Chriſtianity, without convicting all other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of falſehood, becauſe they are deſtitute of thoſe proofs, which are peculiar to the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46528:7"/>
                  <p>I know very well, that there are ſeveral ways which lead to the end which I propoſe. Men that think much, wiſh that a perfect Conformity of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> with the Conſcience of Man might be demonſtrated, from Reflexions on the Heart of Man, and the Dictates of it, which to them would be a convincing, and demonſtrative proof.</p>
                  <p>Others apply themſelves to a ſpeculative exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Doctrines and Proofs of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> to ſhew their Conformity with the Notions of Reaſon: I will not deny but that both theſe employ themſelves uſually in this ſort of ſtudy, and that Truth finds a conſiderable ſupport from their Meditations.</p>
                  <p>But how uſeful ſoever they may be, I have rather choſen to follow another courſe, as thinking it of more advantage, ſolidly to eſtabliſh the Facts which the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> propoſeth; which appears to me to be more proper to perſwade all ſorts of Readers, and better levell'd to the ordinary Capacity of thoſe, who newly enter upon the examination of this Truth.</p>
                  <p>And as the neceſſity of Revelation is generally owned by Heathens, and by all other Nations of the World: I thought it a thing altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to enter upon the examination of ſeveral abſtracted Queſtions, ſuch as theſe: Whether there be any natural knowledge of God, whether
<pb facs="tcp:46528:8"/>Men are naturally inclined to be Religious, and the like? When I ſhall have firmly proved, that God revealed himſelf, that he preſcribed a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the firſt Men, who left the Rules of it to all their Poſterity, from whence all the Religion that ever was, or is yet in the Heathen World, was derived, I ſhall have prevented many very unprofitable Diſputes, and which can only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the mind by their obſcurity.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore confin'd my ſelf to certain Conſiderations, which do ſo eſtabliſh the truth of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, as by their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion they firmly prove the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope, that it will not be thought needful for me to demonſtrate, that the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought not to aboliſh the Chriſtian, as the Chriſtians pretend, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> abrogated the Ceremonial part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as an underſtanding Reader ſhall make ſome Reflexions upon the nature of the Arguments which demonſtrate the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> he may eaſily perceive, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver framed the Model of that Religion, which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> would obtrude upon us.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WE are to conſider three things in the Chriſtian Religion; the Matters of Fact it propounds to us for true, the Promiſes it affords us, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it commands.</p>
                     <p>The Matters of Fact it propounds to us as true, are; that God created the World, that he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46528:12"/>formed the firſt Man, from whom the reſt of mankind have been propagated, that a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Man was created, he violated the Law, God had given him; and that whereas he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have periſhed for this his diſobedience, God was pleaſed, inſtead thereof, to comfort him with the hopes of a Saviour which was to be born of the Seed of his Wife; that God hath actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſent this Saviour into the World, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole Oeconomy of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> His Birth, Life, Preaching, Miracles, Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Promiſes it vouchſafes, are the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Sins, the Reſurrection of our Bodies, and a ſtate abſolutely happy for ever in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, the Worſhip or Divine Service it preſcribes conſiſts in Obedience to the Law of God, in Prayer for the pardon of our Sins, and his Protection, and in a grateful Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what we owe him for all his Benefits towards us.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe three parts of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Truth of the Matters of Fact it relates, may be ſaid to be the foundation of the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> The Promiſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to be perſwaded, that God hath created this World in which we live, and made Mankind of one and the ſame blood; that after the Fall he promiſed to ſave Men, and did actually redeem them in ſending Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuffer'd Death, and being rais'd the third
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46528:12"/>day Aſcended into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to look upon theſe Facts as true with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being aſſured that God will accompliſh the Promiſes he hath made to us.</p>
                     <p>And it is as evident that we cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the truth of theſe Matters, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of a ſtrong obligation laid upon us to perform all the Duties of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as a Man reflects upon his being Gods Creature, he finds himſelf naturally oblig'd, to obey God univerſally, according to his utmoſt ability: but when he comes further to believe, that God did not deſtroy the firſt Man for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; but was graciouſly pleaſed to promiſe him a Saviour for himſelf and all his Poſterity; and when moreover he is aſſured, that God hath really ſent this Saviour in the way and manner the Goſpel relates to us, we cannot conceive, but that he muſt find himſelf under the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements imaginable of rendring to God a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obedience; and believing his Promiſes.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet another obligation whereby Man is bound to obey God, to pray to him, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him all manner of Religious Worſhip; God by redeeming him hath obtained a new claim to, and right over him, and a more indiſpenſable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is laid upon Man to ſubmit himſelf to God in all religious Concerns, as being not only created but alſo redeemed by him.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon acknowledgeth, that if the truth of theſe things be once admitted, nothing can be more juſt and natural, than thoſe conſequences which the Chriſtians thence infer.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46528:13"/>
                     <p>All the difficulty therefore, that occurs in this Matter, conſiſts in the proof of thoſe Facts which the Chriſtian Religion propounds to us; that is to ſay in proving the Creation of the World, the Fall of Man, the Promiſe of a Redeemer, his coming into the World, his Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Foundations of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And indeed theſe are the very matters of which Atheiſts and Libertines require a ſolid proof.</p>
                     <p>And it doth the more concern us to ſatisfie their demands; foraſmuch as the Jews, who are ſcatter'd throughout the whole World, do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our aſſertion, that the Promiſe of ſending the Meſſiah, is already accompliſh'd, tho' they agree upon the matter with us in all other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Moreover the performing this Task may very much contribute to the Converſion of a great number of bad Chriſtians, whoſe ſall and continuance in vices, and licentiouſneſs is to be aſcrib'd to their being ſo weakly perſwaded of the truth of theſe Fundamentals, and that becauſe they have never conſider'd of them with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent attention.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as in order to eſtabliſh the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, we confine our ſelves at preſent to thoſe proofs which make out the Matters of Fact it propoſes; omitting all other arguments, which may evidence the truth of it, tho' poſſibly no leſs convincing; it is obvious, that the proofs we are to produce in confirmation of them, muſt be ſuch as are proper to evince the truth of things long ſince paſt and done.</p>
                     <p>If we were treating of the Events of the time we live in, it might be juſtly required, that we ſhould produce Eye-witneſſes of them; but foraſmuch as the queſtion here is concerning matters long ſince paſt, it is natural for us to have recourſe to Hiſtory, which furniſheth us with the relations of thoſe, who where Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the ſame. This being the only way left us to confirm our belief of things at ſo great a diſtance from us.</p>
                     <p>I am beholding to Hiſtory only for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg I have of a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> an <hi>Alexander,</hi> or a <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and yet having read the account they give me of them, I find them matters I can no way ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally doubt of.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledg that the certainty we have of things long ſince paſt, is much inferiour to that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46528:14"/>which we have of matters confirm'd to us by Eye-witneſſes. Nevertheleſs, becauſe it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Events of ancient Times cannot be confirm'd, but by proofs of this nature, it has never entred into the minds of any to account the exiſtence of ſuch men as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for Fables, upon the pretence, that none now alive did ever ſee them, or becauſe there are ſcarce any traces left of thoſe Empires of which they were the Founders.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the certainty we have of theſe things is ſuch, as nothing can be ſuperadded to it, for tho' it be founded on the Authority of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who liv'd many Ages ago, yet withal we are to conſider that the matters related, do not only carry the Idea of probability and truth along with them, but that they are the very ground and foundation of all the Hiſtories of following Ages; which cannot be queſtioned, if we conſider the connexion and dependance of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, according to the light of Senſe, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>A Matter of Fact then is accounted certain, when it is atteſted by thoſe who were Eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, when recorded by an Hiſtorian, who liv'd amongſt thoſe who had perfect knowledg of it; when the Matter is not gainſaid or contradicted by any; if we find it pen'd at a time, when the things could not be related by any otherwiſe than indeed they were, without expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to publick deriſion: And laſt of all, when the matter is found to be of that nature, as none could be ignorant of it, either becauſe it was the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46528:14"/>intereſt of every one to be inform'd of it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing was ſo publick that it could not be hid from any, or laſtly becauſe of its natural connexion with all thoſe other Events which neceſſarily depend on it.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak plain it is very unjuſt to demand either more proofs, or ſuch as are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the confirmation of the Truth of our Religion, than are required to veriſie any other matters of Fact. Why ſhould not the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Noahs</hi> Children be ſufficient to conclude there was ſuch a man as <hi>Methuſalem</hi> in caſe they aſſure us that they have ſeen him? Or why ſhould not the teſtimony of <hi>Methuſalem</hi> be of credit enough, to prove there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Adam,</hi> if he avers that he ſaw him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with him? Do'nt we every day give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the account which old men give us of their Predeceſſors, eſpecially when we find that what they relate hath an exact reference and conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with thoſe things we are Eye-witneſſes of.</p>
                     <p>But it is an eaſie thing to make it appear, that the proofs which evidence the Truth of the matters which our Religion propoſeth, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ſtrong and convincing.</p>
                     <p>All the circumſtances we can imagine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to evince the Truth of any Relation, do concur to place the matters recorded in Holy Scripture beyond the Reach of doubt or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                     <p>We account the ſingle Teſtimony of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian a ſufficient proof that there was once a very famous Temple at <hi>Delphos</hi> or <hi>Epheſus;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46528:15"/>that all the Monuments remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day to confirm his relation be very doubtful and defective. Whereas I ſhall make it appear that an entire Nation, yea many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do atteſt the truth of thoſe Matters which the Chriſtian Religion propoſes, and that all the Actions, Diſcourſes, and whole Series of Events thereto relating, do furniſh us with an infinite number of characters, which invincibly ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the Truth of the Holy Scrïptures.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Some General Remarks in order to establiſh the Truth of Holy Scripture.</head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as I have undertaken to prove the truth of the Matters of Fact contain'd in our Religion from the teſtimony of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Old and New Teſtament, it will be proper, in order to the executing of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to begin with a general proof of the Truth of the ſaid Books, which will not be difficult if one makes the following remarks.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That it appears from the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he wrote the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, and of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah; of the Deluge, the Riſe and Pedigree of the ſeveral Nations of the World, of the Diviſion of Tongues; and in particular the Hiſtory of the Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> until the entring of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Palestina</hi> 2552 years after the Creation of the World.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46528:15"/>
                     <p>The Second is, That the following Books, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Ruth,</hi> the four Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> with the Books of <hi>Ezrah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> are a Continuation of the ſaid Hiſtory, from the entring of the <hi>Jews</hi> into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,</hi> until their re-eſtabliſhment in the ſaid Country, about the year of the World 3600. Here we read the Conqueſt of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> how it was divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Tribes after they had deſtroyed, drove out or ſubdued the Inhabitants thereof; how often they were brought into bondage by the bordering Nations, whoſe riſe and pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets down. Here we have recorded the ſeveral Names and actions of the Judges, which God from time to time raiſed to the Iſraelites, to reſtore them to their firſt eſtate. Here we have an account of the eſtabliſhment of a Kingly Government amongſt them, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the year 2909; as likewiſe of the diviſion of this people into two Kingdomes, which for three Ages together were moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite in their intereſts, and made great wars againſt each other, as well as againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States. We find here the utter ruin of the moſt puiſſant of theſe two States, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Arms of the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year of the World 3283, and after that, the deſtruction of that of <hi>Judah,</hi> by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> King of the <hi>Chaldeans, Anno Mundi</hi> 3283. And laſt of all we have an account of the <hi>Jews</hi> Reſtoration by <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> under his Succeſſors.</p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46528:16"/>
                     <p>The Third thing obſervable is, That in the remaining Books of the Old Teſtament we find ſeveral hiſtorical Relations relating to both Kingdomes, with ſeveral prophecies relating to their decay and reſtoration, as likewiſe many Diſcourſes of Morality and Piety; and that all theſe relations and prophecies appear to have been writ at ſuch a time, and with thoſe circumſtances, which have a natural reference to what the other Books recite to us, and an eſſential Relation to the Books and Laws of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which we find to be the foundation of all theſe propheſies, relations, and whatſoever elſe we find there concerning their Government or Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is, That the Books of the New Teſtament contain an exact relation of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, who appeared to the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of the eſtabliſhment of his Religion in the World, together with ſome diſputes with the Jews, who refuſed to own him for the Meſſiah promiſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and laſtly Propheſies declaring what in in proceſs of time was to happen both to the Jews and Chriſtians until the end of the World. Theſe Books take the Truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings every where for granted, as alſo of all the other Sacred Writings of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Hiſtorical, Prophetical and Moral.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Four particulars do in a manner give us an intire Idea of the Holy Scripture; and we ſhall ſcarcely ſtand in need of ought elſe to manifeſt the Truth of thoſe Writings, if we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46528:16"/>conſider thoſe undiſputable matters of fact I am now to ſpeak of, and will but make ſome very natural reflexions upon them.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That the Chriſtians, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being divided into ſeveral Sects and Parties, preſently after our Saviours time, have, and do ſtill, in all places, every firſt day of the Week, read the Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament tranſlated into their reſpective Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; ſo that it appears abſolutely impoſſible that any ſpurious Writings ſhould have been ſlipt in amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That as the Chriſtians have had the Books of the Old Teſtament amongſt them in Greek theſe 1600. years, ſo the Heathens had them in that Language 300. years before, being tranſlated by order of one of the <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither a conſiderable party of the Jews were carried, after that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had conquered the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> having overthrown the Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to which the Jews were in ſubjection.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That tho' the Jews had not all the Books of the Old Teſtament from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Commonwealth, they that followed the Party of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and formed the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having only had the Five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt them: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their irreconcilable hatred againſt the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> they have moſt religiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſaid Books from <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3030. in which the diviſions of the two Kingdoms happen'd, even until this day.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46528:17"/>
                     <p>The Fourth and laſt is, That as the Jews e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where at this day, read the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and of the Prophets each Sabbath day (which is alſo obſerved by the Samaritanes) and the Chriſtians read them every firſt day of the week; ſo the Jews have always continued to read them for a long ſeries of Ages, as eſteeming it a great part of the ſanctification of the Sabbath. Beſides which they alſo ſolemnly read them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeventh year in obedience to a Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as being one of the principal parts of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, that the ſole conſideration of theſe matters of fact (which are indiſputable) are ſufficient to prove in general the truth of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, I affirm, that it is as ridiculous to maintain, that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, tranſlated into ſo many Languages, cited by an infinite number of Authors, and which have been the ſubject of various diſputes from the very times of the Apoſtles or ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould be ſuppoſititious, as to aver, that the Books of <hi>Justinian,</hi> or <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcoran, have been falſly obtruded on the World under their names. I ſpeak now only of the Books themſelves, not of the truth of the Hiſtory they contain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that the Books of the Old Teſtament were forged ſince the time of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus;</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they have been in the hands of the Heathens themſelves ever ſince that time.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:46528:17"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is as inconſiſtent to ſuppoſe them contrived ſince the time of the ſeparation of the ten Tribes from <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe we find the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> among the Samaritanes, who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them ever ſince their Revolt, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other change, but what is incident to all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, that paſs through many hands.</p>
                     <p>I grant indeed that the Samaritans have none of the other Books of the Old Teſtament; but this being to be look'd upon only as an effect of their departure from the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> it cannot in the leaſt ſhake the certainty we have of thoſe Books. For firſt the three other Tribes had them and preſerv'd them with the greateſt care, eſteeming them of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Secondly, there were alſo reaſons of State, which made the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to regard the diviſions made by <hi>Joſhuah</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor the authority of the Prieſthood; which Reaſons of State (hereafter mentioned) where the cauſe why the ten Tribes would not allow the ſame authority to ſome of thoſe Books, which were written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Revolt, as thoſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the writings of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> which they did to the Pentateuch of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Moſt of the others we know were pen'd ſince the Diviſion of the two Kingdomes, and ſo did more particularly reſpect the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſome them after the carrying away of the ten Tribes by the Aſſyrians.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee the Truth of theſe Books, and more eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> confirmed till the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46528:18"/>time of the revolt of the ten Tribes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd beyond exception; at leaſt far beyond the certainty we can have of the truth of any other Book in the World. It remains only now to examine, whether as to the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> we find not the ſame certainty, when we look back from the departure of the ten Tribes to the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be the leaſt probability, that they were forged in any part of that interval of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 580 years.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then in the Fourth place, that it is no leſs ridiculous to ſuppoſe them forged during that period. Firſt, becauſe it is impoſſible, that theſe Books ſhould have been forged in the form we now ſee them, but that the Forgery muſt have been apparent to all the World. Nothing could be more notorious, than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jews did read the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath day in all their Families or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and every Seventh year beſides: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was of more eaſie obſervation than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did keep their three ſolemn Feaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, and of Tabernacles: Nothing could be more apparent than whether the Jews did obey the Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Pentateuch, whether relating to particular perſons, to Tribes, or their Lands, and the manner of poſſeſſing of them. Indeed nothing can be imagin'd more abſurd than to ſuppoſe an inſenſible change wrought either in in the Form of their Civil Government, or the Ceremonies of their Religion.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46528:18"/>
                     <p>Indeed it is an unſufferable peice of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to charge the Jews with forging theſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or adulterating of them in this period of time, when it appears they have kept them without any alteration for the ſpace of 2700 years, as hath been ſhewed already: If it be ſaid, that the Jews being divided into two Kingdomes, and diſperſed into diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, were not in a condition to forge or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate any of the ſaid Books, becauſe it might eaſily have been diſcovered; it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſame reaſons took place in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of 580 years, for from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> they were not only greatly divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt themſelves, but almoſt continually ſubject to neighbouring States, who ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by turns, as we ſee in the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover we are to take notice, Firſt that theſe Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> are the riſe and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws and Cuſtomes of the Heathens, as well as of their Fictions, which we ſhall have occaſion to point at in the ſequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Hiſtory contained in the Pentateuch, is evidently confirm'd by the following Books of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> which have an eſſential reference to the ſame, and contain a relation of the publick acts of many Nations, atteſted, and acknowledged by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, who were the mortal Enemies of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the ſaid Books are ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46528:19"/>link'd and related to thoſe publick and known actions, that it is impoſſible to ſeparate the Laws they contain from the Matters of fact atteſted by Pagan Hiſtory, or to be ignorant that the Form of the Jewiſh Government, was nothing elſe, but an execution of the Laws contained in the Pentateuch, which equally lays down that Platform of their Policy and worſhip.</p>
                     <p>My buſineſs at preſent only is to hint theſe general Reflexions concerning the Truth of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament; tho the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel will oblige me to make ſome more particular Reflexions upon each Book, when I ſhall come to conſider the ſeveral Relations they contain.</p>
                     <p>I now come to the Matter in hand, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Book of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> where we find an account of the Creation of the World, the Forming of Man, the Fall, the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, the Propagation of Mankind, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, with other Matters until the Death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which contains the Hiſtory of the World for the ſpace of 2369 years.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. </head>
                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>That the Testimony of</hi> Moſes <hi>concerning the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, is unqueſtionable.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as amongſt thoſe Matters which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46528:19"/>of the Creation of the World in ſeven days, and of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> are ſuch upon which all the reſt do depend (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) it is evident, that I muſt make it my buſineſs in a ſpecial manner to evince the truth of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Towards the confirmation of which matters of fact, the one of which is, that God Created a firſt Man; the other, that God hath promiſed in due time to ſend the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> for Redemption of Mankind from the puniſhment of ſin, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe following Remarks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Law-giver of the <hi>Jews,</hi> laid theſe two Matters of Fact as the Baſis of the Laws he was to publiſh; and he relates them to us, as things which were not only known to him, and ſome others of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, but to all the People of the World; and particularly the whole Nation amongſt whom he lived.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand the force of this Argument we muſt mind three things; the Firſt is, the Nature of the Matters themſelves, the other is the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of him that relates them; and the third, the uſe <hi>Moſes</hi> makes of them.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, nothing was more needful to be known than theſe two things before us; they were Matters which <hi>concern</hi> the whole World, and of which every one ought to be informed; they are Matters about which it is not eaſie to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every one being in a condition to ſatisfie himſelf about them, and of which conſequently they could not but be moſt throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>I dare maintain that there are no Facts in prophane Hiſtory of importance, comparable to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46528:20"/>theſe of the Creation of the World, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> has related them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as for the Author, who relates theſe points, it is as plain that his Character did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully contribute to the making of his Book fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. He was a Man Illuſtrious, as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Education, as the Rank he held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men; a Man equally expos'd to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Enemies and Friends, and who could not vent theleaſt thing contrary to truth, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great importance, without ſeeing himſelf immediately refuted, or rather without expoſing himſelf to publick ſcorn.</p>
                     <p>Beſides I aver, and am ready to maintain, that we find no Author of ſo illuſtrious a Character as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, or who is diſtinguiſh'd with ſo many eſſential marks of Faithfulneſs and Veracity, as appears throughout the whole Tenour of his Writings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This will appear more evidently when we conſider the uſe to which <hi>Moſes</hi> deſigns theſe two Relations of the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word, his deſign was not in furniſhing his Books with the Recitals of theſe important Facts to engage others to read them with more attention, or to get himſelf reputation, by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Curioſity in people for his Books. This would not have been becoming the Gravity and Wiſdom of ſo great a Legiſlator, of whom all ſucceeding Ages have borrowed their Laws.</p>
                     <p>It is apparent, that his end in the recording of theſe Matters was to inſpire with a ſenſe of Piety and Religion, thoſe who were committed to his charge.</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:46528:20"/>
                     <p>This is that which in general we may obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Matters; but more particularly it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his end in recording the Oracles by which God promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> the eſtabliſhing his Poſterity in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the <hi>Jews</hi> the right they had to that Land, according to the deſign and intent of the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>But without making this particular Reflexion, it is clear, that the Law took its beginning at the twelfth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where God preſcribes to his People the manner of celebrating the Paſſover; at leaſt this is the firſt Law which God gave them through the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but foraſmuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> his end was to juſtifie in the minds of his People, the deſign he had to make them leave <hi>Egypt</hi> as well as their pretenſions to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither he was to lead them; it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for him to lay before them the ground of thoſe Pretenſions, which he could not do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relating the whole Series of the Hiſtory until the time of their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which we read in <hi>Geneſis;</hi> the greateſt part of which only concerns the Anceſtors of that People, after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had firſt laid down the grounds of Religion, and that which was known to all Nations.</p>
                     <p>Let us now imagin to our ſelves a Man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all of a ſuddain to introduce into the World the belief of things ſo far diſtant from common apprehenſion as theſe two points muſt needs be, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Creation, and the Promiſe of Chriſt, in caſe we ſuppoſe them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally unknown. Let us yet further conceive a Man not only relating thoſe things, but making
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46528:21"/>them the foundation of a new ſort of Laws never before heard of. Is there any Wit, or Judgment in ſuch an undertaking? Can we therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Writings teſtifie his great Wiſdom, ſhould ever have entertain'd ſuch unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable thoughts.</p>
                     <p>I dare aver that there was any never Legiſlator ſo ſtupid and inconſiderate, as to pretend to engage a whole people to ſubmit themſelves to the yoke of obedience, and to receive a great number of Laws reſpecting their Civil Government and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by declaring to them two Fictions, of which they had never before had the leaſt Idea.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very conſiderable, that theſe things are not recited by <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Preface to the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, as if then firſt they had been propoſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the People by God; but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets them down as Truths known to them all, and as Principles, univerſally admitted, and ſuch as the meer mentioning of them could not but ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage the <hi>Jews</hi> to render a ready obedience to the Laws which God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> in their preſence of the Divine Authority, of which their very Senſes were convinc'd.</p>
                     <p>Let us alſo conſider the nature of thoſe things, the Relation of which <hi>Moſes</hi> has joined with theſe two General Points, to make an impreſſion on the Minds of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Let us conſider the account he gives them of their Anceſtors, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or farther off, whom he repreſents as equally inform'd of theſe Matters, as having ſeverally delivered the knowledge of them to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and having join'd to theſe firſt Truths of the Creation, and the Promiſe of a Saviour, many
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46528:21"/>other Notions thereon depending, and which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hopes and expectations, to the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> And now judge whether <hi>Moſes</hi> were not to be accuſed of great folly and ſenſeleſneſs, if he had proceeded to make ſuch a vaſt People (all of the ſudden) to receive for Truths publickly and generally owned, what indeed was nothing but the moſt ridiculous and ill cohering Romance that ever was broached.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince as it is viſible (taking in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances I have hinted) that the Authority of ſuch an Hiſtorian and Law-giver as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, relating ſuch importent Matters cannot be call'd in queſtion; it follows, that the Atheiſt can have nothing to object againſt his Teſtimony with the leaſt ſhadow or pretence of reaſon. So that we may already aſſert, that there is nothing better atteſted than the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of Chriſt, which are the immoveable Foundations of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs for a more evident Conviction, we are willing, before we draw this Concluſion, to make it appear how weak and inconſiderable all thoſe Objections are, which Atheiſts can poſſibly frame againſt what <hi>Moſes</hi> relates concerning theſe Matters.</p>
                     <p>What can they with Reaſon object? Perhaps they'l ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> is not the Author of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but that it was foiſted in under his Name, and conſequently, that whatſoever is built upon the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his evidence, is all without ground. Or they may object, that if <hi>Moſes</hi> be indeed the Author of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that he lived at ſuch a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46528:22"/>diſtance of time from the things which he relates, that it makes void the authority of his Writings. They may moreover alledge, that <hi>Moſes</hi> relates things impoſſible, and of which therefore thoſe that mentioned them before, the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being ſo long ſince paſt and done, could not be fully inform'd of, and that they may well be ſuppos'd greatly changed and alter'd by a Tradition of ſo many Ages. They may alſo alledge, that according to the common Opinion, <hi>Moſes</hi> penn'd not theſe things as an Hiſtorian, but as a Prophet; and that the apprehenſion of moſt concerning his Books are, that he wrote of things, whereof the knowledge before his time, was very obſcure and confuſe, or rather were generally unknown.</p>
                     <p>They may object againſt theſe relations of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that which the moſt ancient People, ſuch as the <hi>Aegyptians, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Chineſe,</hi> alledge for their Antiquity, which far ſurpaſſeth the date of the World according to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principal ways to aſſault the Truths which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, either by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Atheiſts on one hand, that the things which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, are indeed mentioned by other Authors, but that they forged them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or that <hi>Moſes</hi> being an able and refin'd Politician deſign'd by Creating a belief of theſe Matters in the <hi>Jews,</hi> to make them more ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and obedient to him.</p>
                     <p>In a Word, it may be ſaid, that ſuppoſing the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to be writ by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was an eaſie matter for him to dictate whatſoever he pleaſed to a People who were under a Law that made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46528:22"/>it Capital to call in queſtion the truth of his Relations, or the Authority of his Laws.</p>
                     <p>This certainly is the fartheſt, to which the height of Obſtinacy can carry this matter, and the very laſt refuge of the ſtrongeſt prejudice. But it is an eaſie matter to confound the Atheiſts and Libertines in every one of theſe Articles, and to ſhew that all their Objections do in effect ſerve for nothing elſe but to make a more lively impreſſion of this Argument taken from Matter of fact, which I have undertaken to ſet forth in a full and clear light.</p>

                     <p>I Shall in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe make it appear, that we cannot with reaſon, conteſt the Authority of a Tradition which hath thoſe Characters which we find in the Relations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> The only thing that can be queſtion'd in this matter is, Whether <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the great Captain of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Common-wealth, be the Author of it. This therefore is the thing which we ought ſolidly to evince.</p>
                     <p>Tho it ſeems that we might diſpenſe with this trouble: foraſmuch as it is eaſie to ſhew, that the greateſt part of the moſt conſiderable Events,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46528:23"/>which are recorded in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> were generally believed by others, as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At leaſt it muſt be granted, that theſe Matters have given occaſion to moſt of their Fables, <hi>viz.</hi> To that of the Chaos, to that of the Marriage of <hi>Peleus</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> for the forming of Man to that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> to that of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s continued Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the ſeven firſt days of his Life, which they look'd upon as the Original of the Solemnity of the ſeventh day, known amongſt the Heathens; to that of the Golden Age, and of the Deluge; to the Name of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> to the Fable of <hi>Janus,</hi> to that of the Diviſion of the World amongſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'s Sons, to the Name of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> to the Fable of the <hi>Titans,</hi> and of the changing of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into Statues of Stone; to the Stories of the Inceſt the Gods committed with their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to that of the firing of the World by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton;</hi> and to a great number of other Fictions, which cannot be otherwiſe explained, as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have ſhewn at large.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever was the Author of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> whether <hi>Moſes</hi> or another, ſure it is that he was exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Matters he relates, and that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſoon after <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then I ſay, that it appears he was fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of thoſe matters of which he treats; he ſets down the Names of the Heads or Fathers of the ſeveral Nations of the World, and does it ſo, that what he ſaith doth very well agree with what the moſt Ancient Hiſtorians have left us concerning that matter: He ſpeaks of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Countreys they poſſeſt, and their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46528:23"/>Kings, as of things he was perfectly inform'd of: He very carefully diſtinguiſhes the Original of theſe ſeveral Nations; and the ſame being at that time commonly known, no Hiſtorian could repreſent them otherwiſe than they were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing himſelf to the laughter of all by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to mix Fables with Relations of this nature.</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, I ſay, that this Book was writ by a Man that lived ſoon after <hi>Joſeph:</hi> He ſpeaks very exactly of what <hi>Joſeph</hi> did in his place of chief Miniſter to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> in particular, he ſets down the firſt Original of the fifth Penny which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſo many Ages after, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay to their Kings, being a thing which no <hi>Egyptian</hi> could be ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, It is viſible, that this Book ſerves for an Introduction to <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the following Books, which have no other Foundation, but the truth of thoſe things which are related to us there; and do throughout allude and refer to the ſeveral paſſages of it; and that all Matters of Religion and Worſhip, contained in them, are founded upon the truth of the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which we find in <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and upon the truth of all thoſe other ſucceeding Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, until the coming of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was chief Favourite, and Miniſter of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we have yet a more eaſie way to make out that <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory is contain'd in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the following Books, is the Author of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:46528:24"/>
                     <p>For firſt, it cannot be deny'd, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves have acknowledged <hi>Moſes</hi> for the moſt antient Law-giver; for this, we have the Teſtimonies of <hi>Plato, Polemus, Artapanus, Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Theopompus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who places <hi>Moſes</hi> in the front of Six of the moſt antient Law givers thus; <hi>Moſes, Sauchnis, Seſonchoſis, Bachoris, Amaſis,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> Father of <hi>Xerxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But further, if when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> tell us of the Laws of their Law-giver <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> of thoſe of their <hi>Solon,</hi> we think our ſelves oblig'd to believe them; becauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally every Nation is ſuppos'd to be a faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitary of the Laws of him who firſt founded their Government; yea, if we do not in the leaſt doubt of theſe Relations, though there be no People at this day, who live according to the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Solon;</hi> can any valuable reaſon be imagined, for us to doubt, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when an entire Nation have conſtantly averr'd, that he did ſo? I ſay, when all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who continue at this day, do in all places, where they are ſcatter'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World equally, and with one conſent, maintain, that they received this Book from him, together with the Laws and Worſhip therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd? Nay, when it is notorious, that many of them have ſuffer'd Martyrdom in confirmation of this Truth?</p>
                     <p>I omit now to mention the conſent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who tho' they be not deſcended of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and do not obſerve the greateſt part of the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet do not ceaſe highly to defend this truth throughout the World, the Goſpel in their ſenſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46528:24"/>being nothing elſe, but the literal accompliſhment of that Promiſe, <hi>The Seed of the Woman, ſhall bruiſe the Head of the Serpent.</hi> I ſhall ſhew in the Sequel of theſe my Reflexions, with how much Juſtice they aſſent to this Truth; but at preſent I tie my ſelf only to the Teſtimonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which confirms the Authority thereof.</p>

                     <p>I Should never have done, ſhould I go about to ſet down all the Obſervations which might be made incomparing this Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> with other Hiſtories, commonly known to the World; and whoſe faithfulneſs is unqueſtionable. Without entring upon this compariſon, we may boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that there is no Hiſtory in the World, whoſe Author we can be ſo ſure of, as that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Pen-man of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>

                     <p>But I go further, and aſſert, that the <hi>Jews</hi> could not be miſtaken in the Teſtimonies they give to this Truth, which I prove by theſe two Remarks.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That their Obſervations both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Religious, are at this day founded upon no other Principles, than thoſe which we find in <hi>Geneſis:</hi> As for inſtance, they compute the beginning of their day from the preceding Evening; they

                     <p>The Second is, That the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for granted, that the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as his Anceſtors, had always obſerv'd the Sabbath and Circumciſion; and the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ordering the ſame to be conſtantly read in every Family, to which the Sabbath day was more peculiarly appropriated, and the whole to be read over every ſeventh year, as we know the <hi>Jews</hi> practice was according to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the firſt of which Injunctions they practice ſtill in all places, and have left off the other, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they cannot do it now they are out of their own Land: I ſay, ſuppoſing all this, it is abſolutely impoſſible, that any other than <hi>Moſes,</hi> could have made this Book to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>The forgery at the beginning, would have been palpable, even to Children themſelves: As for Example, let us ſuppoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> had form'd a deſign of deceiving the People, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> for a Book of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Is it poſſible he ſhould ſo far impoſe on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to make them to receive the ſaid Book all at once, as that which had been conſtantly read in their Families every ſeventh day, and year, and that for 600 years before his time? and therefore,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46528:28"/>as a Book that had been ſo long in all their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, tho' indeed it was never heard of by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time.</p>
                     <p>If an Impoſtor can create a Belief in others, that he hath ſome ſecret Communication with the Deity; thoſe who are thus perſwaded by him, will eaſily ſubmit themſelves to his Laws; but it is abſolutely impoſſible, that a whole People ſhould all at once, forget whatſoever they have learn'd, or heard of their Parents and Fore-Fathers, and inſtead thereof, admit of Tales forged at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Some Nations have been ſo ridiculous, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive themſelves from a Fabulous Original, but they never fell into ſuch Miſtakes about thoſe things which were at no great diſtance from the time in which they lived.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we know that theſe Fabulous Originals never made ſo lively an impreſſion upon the Minds of a whole Nations, eſpecially the Learned amongſt them, as generally to be believed; but we rather find, that they have endeavoured to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to truth, by ſhewing ſomething elſe was hinted thereby, as we may ſee by the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Heathens themſelves have given us of all their Fables, and utterly rejected thoſe which they could not reconcile to good ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>But in this caſe we find a whole Nation to this very day maintaining all the Matters of Fact rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and in particular, that of the Creation, as of Matters whoſe Memorial they have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated every ſeventh day, ſince the time they firſt happened.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:46528:29"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, It cannot be deny'd, but that this Book was conſtantly uſed to be read amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially on the Sabbath day, and that under the Name of <hi>Moſes:</hi> For inſtance, ſince the time of Jeſus Chriſt, or ſince that of <hi>David.</hi> Neither can it be denied, but this conſtant reading was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by virtue of a Law contain'd in the ſaid Book: Now if this Law has always been in this Book from the firſt appearing of it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be queſtion'd; how was it poſſible to forge and foiſt in this Book under the Name of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government. I ſay, this Book, which beſides all this, contains ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Matters, and is the very Foundation of all their Religion.</p>
                     <p>I will not repeat here what I mention'd in the third Chapter, to make the Vanity of thoſe Men appear, who imagine the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the four that follow it, might have been forged by others, under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Name: Yet I think I ought, before I proceed further, to remove a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulty, which is often alledg'd by this ſort of People: For ſay they, it cannot be, that theſe Books were ever read, with that care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy we ſpeak of, becauſe a time can be point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, wherein the ſaid Book was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah;</hi> and indeed, the Hiſtory plainly informs us, that the Book of the Law was found again in the Reign of <hi>Joſias,</hi> from whence they infer, that if it were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, it might as well be forged.</p>
                     <p>But indeed, they may conclude from hence, that which willingly we allow them, that there was a time wherein Ungodlineſs did prevail, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46528:29"/>Idolatry was publickly eſtabliſh'd in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> it ſelf, yet can they not from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance draw any other Conſequence which might ſupport their pretenſions.</p>
                     <p>They muſt needs acknowledge firſt, that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not only amongſt the three Tribes, but alſo amongſt the ten, ſince the time of their Revolt under <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> that they who were carried by <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> had the ſaid Books amongſt them, as well as thoſe of the ten Tribes, who were left in their own Countrey. Thus we ſee, that when the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> ſent ſome of the Prieſts of <hi>Samaria</hi> to inſtruct the Colony which he had ſetled in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in the Law of God; it is not ſaid, that thoſe Prieſts went to borrow the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> from them of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor that the ſaid Laws was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown in that Countrey; but only that they had formerly violated the Law of God, in ſerving ſtrange Gods, as they ſtill did, but that withal, they kept the Law of God, which to this day is yet found among their Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is evident that tho the wickedneſs and violence of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> cauſed a great change in Matters of Religion, yet not ſo great, but that his Subjects notwithſtanding, had ſtill the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt them; the Blood which he ſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was an evident ſign, that there were ſome Godly men left amongſt them, who continued true to their Religion, and obſerved the Laws of God. Beſides, if we conſider his Repentance, we muſt conclude, that towards the end of his Reign, he did in ſome degree, re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the purity of that Religion he had before
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46528:30"/>prophaned, a main part of which, was the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reading of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to thoſe Laws before mention'd.</p>
                     <p>In the third place it is viſible, that the reaſon why <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> having found the Book of the Law in the Temple as they were cleanſing and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſent the ſame to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> was not becauſe there was no other ſuch Book left in <hi>Judah,</hi> but becauſe the ſaid Book being written by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, there ſeem'd to be ſomething very extraordinary in the finding of it at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, when they were endeavouring a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and it was this Circumſtance which did in a more particular manner excite the Zeal of this good Prince. And indeed, if we ſuppoſe that <hi>Joſiah</hi> had never before ſeen the Book of the Law, how could he have apply'd himſelf to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his Countrey, his People, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the manner which is recorded in the Book of Kings? How could a ſufficient number of Copies of it be diſperſed over all his Kingdom in an inſtant, to inform the People about the Ceremonials of the Paſſover, which ſoon after was ſo Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated by them? Or, how is it poſſible, that the <hi>Levites,</hi> the Prieſts, and People, could have been all of the ſuddain inſtructed in all the points to be obſerved in the performing of that Holy Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>It is apparent, that the Sacred Hiſtorian did for no other reaſon take notice of this Circumſtance, that the Book found, was of <hi>Moſes</hi> own hand Writing, but to make it appear, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout reſpect for this Book, was not wholly ſtifled, as having been by them carefully hid from the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46528:30"/>fury of their Idolatrous Kings, and laid up in ſome ſecret place of the Temple, where now they had ſo happily found it again.</p>
                     <p>Over and above what hath been ſaid already, we are to obſerve, that how great ſoever the wickedneſs of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, as well as that of their Subjects, yet the ſame generally conſiſted in nothing elſe, but the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Worſhip of their Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to ſome particulars, which tho they were forbid by the Law, yet they left the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of their Religion in full force. This we have an inſtance of in the time of <hi>Ahab,</hi> where we find <hi>Elijah</hi> reproaching the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the Monſtrous Alliance they had made betwixt the Worſhip of God, and that of <hi>Baal,</hi> which Queen <hi>Jeſabel</hi> had introduc'd.</p>
                     <p>All this clearly proves, that the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which is the firſt of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was never forged under his Name, ſince it was always owned as the Writing of that Famous Author, and is ſtill ſo acknowledged by the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day.</p>

                        <hi>That it appears from</hi> Geneſis, <hi>that the Sabbath was conſtantly obſerved from the beginning of the World until</hi> Moſes.</head>
                     <p>THe other Objection of the Atheiſts (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Author of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as we have now proved) is this, that it ſeems ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to give credit to the Relations of a Perſon who lived ſo many Ages diſtant from the things he recites. To anſwer this Objection we muſt firſt of all declare to them, by what means the Memory of the Fact which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſo lively and entire, as to give <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct a knowledge of them, and that it was not in his power to forge or add any thing of his own, it being a thing known to the whole World, as well as himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is no way whereby we can more ſolidly evince, that it is impoſſible the Creation of the World ſhould be forged by <hi>Moſes,</hi> than by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appear, that the Law of the Sabbath hath a natural Relation to the Creation of the World, and that it hath been always conſtantly obſerved from that time until <hi>Moſes.</hi> The ſame alſo will help us clearly to conceive after what manner the Memory of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> hath been preſerv'd ſo diſtinct amongſt thoſe that lived ſince the Creation until <hi>Moſes.</hi> We are no ſooner inform'd that the Sabbath is a ſolemn day, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46528:31"/>at firſt to celebrate and perpetuate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Creation, but we judge it impoſſible, that ſo important an event commemorated every ſeventh day, by vertue of a Divine Law, ſhould be an impoſture. But foraſmuch as this impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is grounded on theſe two Propoſitions; the one, that God gave this Law of the Sabbath to the firſt Man; the other, that the ſame was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his Poſterity ever ſince, till the time of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that God only renew'd it in the Law given from Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> theſe are the Truths I am now to clear, and it is of more importance to be proved, becauſe, tho the generality of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Ancient and Modern, <hi>Jews</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are of this Opinion, yet there are ſome of the Chriſtian Fathers who ſeem to deny that the Sabbath was ever obſerv'd by the Patriarchs. But it will be an eaſie matter to prove from <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Antiquity of the Sabbath is ſuch as I aſſert, and at the ſame time to demonſtrate the truth of the Creation, as well as of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> which in a manner immediately follow'd it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. II. 3.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf thus: <hi>And God bleſſed the ſeventh day and Sanctified it, becauſe that in it, he had reſted from all his work, which he had Created:</hi> Which words clearly evince a Solemn Conſecration of the ſeventh day to God's Service, by its being made a Commemoration of his finiſhing the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it may be ſaid, that the intent of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place was only to ſet down the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God ſet apart this day, of all others, to his Service, by the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46528:32"/>are to take notice, that this appointment was made for Man's ſake already placed in the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> This we may gather from the order <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerves. For he ſets down firſt the Formation of Man on the ſixth day, and his being plac'd in Paradiſe, which he gives a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of in the ſecond Chapter, and after theſe, he relates God's reſting from his Works, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Sabbath with the reaſon of that Law which he impos'd on Man; and then adds, <hi>Theſe are the Generations of the Heavens and of the Earth, when they were Created, in the day that the Lord God made the Heaven and the Earth.</hi> All that precedes theſe words, is only a Relation of what paſs'd in the ſeven firſt days, and that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets down concerning Gods bleſſing of the ſeventh day, and his Conſecrating it, ought as well to be accounted a Law appointing the ſeventh day for his Service, as thoſe other Bleſſings, given to the Creatures according to their kinds, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as inviolable Laws of God, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof they ſubſiſt, and are perpetuated each according to their kind, by the way of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, it is very remarkable, that the Patriarchs, maintain'd a Publick Worſhip, at leaſt ſince the time of <hi>Seth;</hi> which it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhould be determined to ſome certain day; and ſince we find, that even at this time they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd between Beaſts clean and unclean, with reſpect to their Sacrifices (which they could not do but from Revelation) we have much more reaſon to conclude, that God had ſet apart a time for own Worſhip and Service.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:46528:32"/>
                     <p>And indeed, there are many evident ſigns, that even then the 7 day was obſerved.
<note place="margin">Kimchi Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. in Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</note> I will not here peremptorily aſſert that antient Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which tells us, that the ninety ſecond Pſalm, whoſe Title is <hi>a Pſalm for the Sabbath,</hi> was made by <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, who was made on the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath: But this I dare aſſert, that it is apparent,
<note place="margin">Gen. VIII. 10.12.</note> that what we read in the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> about the Deluge, doth refer to this cuſtom, where we find <hi>Noah</hi> ſending forth the Dove and the Raven on the ſeventh day, which plainly hints to us his obſerving of that day; for it ſeems, that <hi>Noah</hi> having, in an eſpecial manner, on that ſolemn day, implored the aſſiſtance of God in the Aſſembly of his Family, he expected a particular Bleſſing from it.</p>
                     <p>And we cannot but make ſome Reflexion on that which we read in the XXIX of <hi>Geneſis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the term of a Week ſet apart to the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of <hi>Leah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. XXIX. 27.</note> where at the twenty ſeventh Verſe <hi>Laban</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf. <hi>Fulfil her Week, and we will give thee this alſo, for the Service which thou ſhalt ſerve with me yet ſeven other Years.</hi> This Week here doth ſo plainly ſignifie a Week of days that it cannot be more naturally expreſs'd; and indeed, all generally underſtand by this Week of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Feaſt of <hi>Leah,</hi> that term of time which in ſucceeding Ages hath been cuſtomary to allot to Nuptial Feſtivals, as appears from the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> where the Wedding Feaſt of <hi>Vaſthi</hi> laſted ſeven days, this term of ſeven days having ſo long ſince been Conſecrated to Nuptial Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings.</p>
                     <p>The ſame we may alſo gather from the time
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46528:33"/>which was ordinarily allotted to mourning for the Dead, to which we find the Patriarchs allotted a term proportion'd to that of their rejoicing. For as we ſee that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> mourned ten Weeks for <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe of his Quality, as being the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſo we find that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and thoſe that accompanied him, mourned ſeven days at his Enterment in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> And as we find, that this Cuſtom was perpetually afterwards obſerv'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears from <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> XXII. 12. ſo likewiſe we find the ſame obſerved by the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> at the beginning of his nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De fide Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur. in obitu Sat.</hi> p. 321. Seven days were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after that the Lord had ſmote the River. <hi>Jalkut</hi> in h. l.</note> and from them it paſſed to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as we find in St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It appears from <hi>Exod.</hi> VII. 25. that God obſerved ſeven days after he had ſmote the River to change the Waters thereof into Blood; from whence the <hi>Jews</hi> conclude, that the three Plagues <hi>Viz.</hi> that of Blood, of Frogs, and of Lice, abode on the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſix days, and were withdrawn on the ſeventh, which is the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo gather, if we calculate the time exactly, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> obſerved the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. We find from the Hiſtory of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the ſame happened on a <hi>Thurſday,</hi> being the fifteenth of the Month <hi>Niſan,</hi> and the day in which they ſung thoſe Hymns of Deliverance, was the Sabbath which God had particularly ſet apart for this Week.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo evident from <hi>Exod.</hi> XVI. that the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath was obſerv'd by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> before the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> For we find God ſpeaking there concerning the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46528:33"/>not as of a thing newly inſtituted, but as of an antient Law, which they wer e not to tranſgreſs by gathering the Manna on that day; for he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to gather a double portion the ſixth day, and not to gather any on the ſeventh. We ſee that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reſting on the ſeventh day is here ſuppoſed a known and cuſtomary thing, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them by a Law of old.</p>
                     <p>They who went forth to gather Manna on the ſeventh day are repreſented as Tranſgreſſors of a known Law, as appears from the words of the Lord to <hi>Moſes. How long refuſe ye to keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and my Laws? Moſes</hi> alſo ſpeaks of the Sabbath which was to be the next day, as of a thing cuſtomary, and received amongſt them. <hi>To morrow</hi> (ſaith he, at <hi>v.</hi> 23.) <hi>is the reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of holineſs unto the Lord;</hi> words which would have been unintelligible to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and expreſs'd a Law, altogether impracticable, in caſe they had been deſtitute of any further knowledge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and had not been acquainted, that it was the very day in which the great work of Creation had been finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>My fourth Obſervation I take from the very words of the Decalogue, where firſt of all we find God ſpeaking in this manner, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day;</hi> which words clearly import,
<note place="margin">Exod. XX. 8.</note> that the Law he gave, was not a new Law, but indeed as old as the World, and which had been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Forefathers. It ſeems probable alſo, that God expreſſes himſelf in theſe terms, becauſe the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had forc'd them to break this Law, by obliging them to deliver their Tale of Bricks every day, without excepting the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46528:34"/>which before he had allowed them to keep.</p>
                     <p>This is explained very diſtinctly in the fifth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and ſeems to have been the occaſion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s demanding Straw of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> to go and Sacrifice, in anſwer to which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<note place="margin">Exod. V. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> expreſſes himſelf in terms which ſhew that formerly they had obſerved a reſt on that day: However it be, yet thus much is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that God commands them to make their Bond Servants to obſerve the Sabbath, becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by their example inclin'd them not to be very careful in exempting them from all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on that day.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in the ſecond place we are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in the laſt words of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God ſpeaks of it as of a thing formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and determin'd by him, ſaying, <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and reſted the ſeventh day, wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it;</hi> which words have a manifeſt and undeniable reference to that which happen'd the ſeventh day after the Creation, and to the Law then given to Man concerning it.</p>
                     <p>We may gather from the fourth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the ſenſe which we have put upon the third Verſe of the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> is the ſame which the <hi>Jews</hi> have always had of it. The Apoſtle diſcourſing from thoſe words of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. XCV. <hi>To whom I ſware in my wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my reſt,</hi> doth ſuppoſe a threefold reſt, the firſt of which, is the reſt of the Sabbath, of which mention is made in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where we have the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it; the ſecond was the reſt in the Land
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46528:34"/>of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all thoſe Tryals in the Wilderneſs: the third, the reſt in Heaven, of which the two foregoing were but the Figures. He argues therefore, that theſe words of <hi>David</hi> could not be underſtood, concerning the Sabbath day; foraſmuch as from the beginning of the World Men entred into that reſt of the Sabbath; and he proves this, by that paſſage in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> of which he only cites the firſt words, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God reſted the ſeventh day from all his works,</hi> as ſuppoſing that the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom he wrote, had no need of having the following words quoted to them, which tell us, that <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it:</hi> that is, he Conſecrated the ſame to his worſhip and ſervice, foraſmuch as nothing was more publickly and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally known amongſt them, the Obſervation of the Sabbath being a thing generally received, even before the giving of the Law.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, the <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> be of opinion, that the practice of Solemnizing that day, had ſuffer'd ſome interruption; and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Law of the Sabbath was given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet it is well known firſt of all,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Euſeb</hi> praep Evang. l. 13. c. 12.</note> that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> in a Treatiſe dedicated by him to <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> cites ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Homer, Heſiod,</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> Heathen Poets, which mention the ſeventh day as a Feſtival, and Solemn day, becauſe all things were finiſhed in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, it is notorious, that if ſome of the Fathers, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> writing againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> have deny'd that the Patriarchs obſerved the ſeventh day, they did ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46528:35"/>rather with regard to the rigor of that Law, which forbad all manner of work on that day upon pain of Death, (which was ſuperadded by God to the firſt Law of the Sabbath) than to the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabbath, as it was a day appointed to make a Solemn Commemoration of the Creation of the World.</p>
                     <p>In a word, we are to take notice, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which God makes between the Sabbath, obſerv'd by the Patriarchs, and that which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> did conſiſt in two things: Firſt, in that God did impoſe an abſolute neceſſity upon the <hi>Jews</hi> to abſtain from all manner of work, even to the very dreſſing of Meat, neceſſary for the ſupport of Life: We find this diſtinction clearly expreſs'd in the Law which God gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt and ſeventh day of the Feaſt of Unleavened Bread, for he abſolutely forbids all manner of work on theſe two days, as much as on the Sabbath, even the preparing of neceſſary food, which he permits the five other days, forbidding only Servil Laborious Works.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In that the working on that day by the Law, is made puniſhable with death, which was not ſo before; which Innovation, and new rigour of the Law, eſtabliſhed by God, was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, by the puniſhing of him who had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Sticks on the Sabbath day, whereas we find, that before the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> God did not command thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> to be puniſhed with death, who went forth the ſeventh day to gather Manna, according to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of dreſſing their Meat on that day.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:46528:35"/>
                     <p>Let me add this further, that tho the Apoſtles had aboliſhed the rigour of the Law concerning the Sabbath, introduced by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obſerved it; which practiſe of theirs, in all probability, gave occaſion to the Chriſtians, for almoſt four Centuries, to keep the Sabbath as well as the firſt day of the Week, Solemnizing both thoſe days, the one as a Commemoration of the Creation of the World, and the other of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But what ever Judgment may be paſt on this laſt Remark, it is very evident from <hi>Geneſis</hi> and <hi>Exodus:</hi> Firſt, that the Law of the Sabbath was obſerved before <hi>Moſes:</hi> Secondly, that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation was by the firſt Patriarchs propagated among the Heathens alſo, as well as the Idea of the Creation; or as the practice of Sacrificing, with the other parts of Religious Worſhip, the Original whereof, may be ſeen in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as we ſhall make appear in our following Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>After all this, we muſt conclude againſt the Atheiſt, that either <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt imprudently have laid a Snare for himſelf, in forging a matter of fact, of which, not only the <hi>Jews,</hi> but all the World were able to convince him, ſince there were none amongſt them but muſt needs be Conſcious whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had obſerved the Sabbath in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Creation, as he relates it, or no; or elſe, that the Creation of the World, being a matter of fact ſo generally known, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of it Solemnized every ſeventh day by all thoſe who preceded him, muſt needs be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted and immoveable truth, which I ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46528:36"/>farther evince by thoſe Obſervations which I ſhall raiſe from the dependance and connexion, which the Matters related by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> have with the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This is my buſineſs at preſent, in performing of which I ſhall make it appear, that nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd more rational and coherent, than the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in which the Atheiſts imagine, that they diſcover ſo great Abſurdities.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THo' it might be thought more natural in theſe our Diſquiſitions about the Hiſtory of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> to begin with thoſe matters which happened near the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from them to paſs to thoſe at a greater diſtance, yet I have choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow the Thread of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſcourſe, hoping that this Method will afford more light to theſe our Reflexions: At leaſt, it will ſpare me the trouble of frequent Repetitions, which in the other way I ſhould be neceſſarily oblig'd to. I begin then with this, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>was convinced of his Creation, both by Reaſon and Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> being a thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he muſt firſt be convinced of it himſelf, before he could perſwade his Poſterity to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the belief of it, it is worth our enquiry to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46528:36"/>know what ways he had to aſſure himſelf, that he was indeed Created in that manner as <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. And, foraſmuch as the certainty of this Tradition depends upon the Authority of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppoſes to have been the firſt Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of it: It is plain, that we muſt be aſſured that <hi>Adam</hi> could not deceive himſelf in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is evident enough that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Children, when he took care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them concerning it.</p>
                     <p>As to his own Exiſtence, he could not but be as ſtrongly perſwaded of it, as we are of ours, all the difficulty lying in the manner how he came to exiſt. Now there were two ways by which <hi>Adam</hi> might inform himſelf of this, <hi>viz.</hi> by Reaſon, and the Teſtimony of Authority. He could eaſily find out this Secret by a rational Reflexion: Or, he might alſo be perſwaded of it by God himſelf, who had Created him, not to mention now any information which he might have from the Angels who were Witneſſes of his Creation.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe Tradition <hi>Moſes</hi> has recorded, ſuppoſes, that he had learnt of God himſelf the manner of his own Formation. God ſpeaks to <hi>Adam,</hi> and Sanctifies the ſeventh day; that is, obliges <hi>Adam</hi> to keep the Memorial of his Creation, he ties him by a Law to Commemorate his Creation fifty two times a Year, and to render him continual thanks for the Being he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>But, foraſmuch as <hi>Adam</hi> was capable of making Reflexions upon thoſe ſeveral matters, which God had made known to him concerning his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I ſay, it cannot be imagin'd, but that he muſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46528:37"/>have taken theſe things into conſideration, and have been convinc'd of the truth of them, by the light of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The truth of a Relation conſiſting in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, with the matter related, it appears clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Adam</hi> could certainly know the truth of what God had declared to him, by examining the things themſelves.</p>
                     <p>We may diſtinguiſh ſeveral Propoſitions in the Revelation God made to him concerning the manner of his Creation.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was, That his Body was taken from the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The next, That his Soul was not framed before his Body.</p>
                     <p>The Third, That his Soul had been joyned to his Body to conſtitute one individual Perſon.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth, That he was Created in a full and perfect Age.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth, That his Wife was formed of a Rib, taken out of his ſide, during the time that he was caſt into a deep Sleep.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Truths I propoſe as inſtances, the rather becauſe there is not one of them of which <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf could be a Witneſs.</p>
                     <p>And yet I affirm, there is none of theſe which he could not be aſſured of by the light of reaſon, being convinc'd of them by the ſame means which aſſured him of the Exiſtence of his Soul and Body. The Conſideration therefore of theſe two Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was of good uſe to confirm the Revelation which God had vouchſafed him concerning his Creation, of which he could not be a Witneſs himſelf.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:46528:37"/>
                     <p>That his Body was taken from the Earth, <hi>Adam</hi> might eaſily infer, from the food that maintain'd it; for what is the matter of Man's nouriſhment, but a digeſted, and diſguiſed Earth? And finding himſelf, at firſt, in a perfect eſtate, it was natural for him to Judge that his Body had been thus at once framed of the Earth, without paſſing thoſe ſeveral degrees of growth, whereby Children ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to their juſt Stature.</p>
                     <p>And he might as eaſily be aſſured, that his Soul was not formed before his Body. The Soul is a Being, conſcious of his own Operations and Thoughts, wherefore he needed only make this Reflexion: <hi>My Soul has had neither knowledge nor thoughts before it was united to my Body; therefore my Soul did not exiſt before it.</hi> No great ſtudy was required to make ſo natural a Concluſion as this is.</p>
                     <p>Again, how could he be ignorant of the union of his Soul with the Body? Was it not obvious for him to be aſſur'd hereof, by the ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he ſaw his Body yield unto his Soul? He had the Idea of a Tree, as well as the Idea of his Foot or Arm, whence it was eaſie for him to reflect thus: <hi>How comes it to paſs, that I command my Feet and my Arms, and that I cannot do the ſame to a Stone or Tree, tho' I have the Idea of the one, as well as of the other?</hi> Muſt not this proceed from, a nearer union it hath with the one, than with the other? He knew that this union continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Sleep, and was independent of his Will. In a word, he had the ſame proofs of this union, which we have of it at preſent, only they were in him much more lively, becauſe our Infancy makes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46528:38"/>us in ſome ſort ignorant of the Nature of our Souls, our Souls accuſtoming themſelves by little and little, to depend upon the Senſes, ſo as not to be able to raiſe themſelves, without ſome trouble, above their Operations.</p>
                     <p>Neither was it leſs evident to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he was produced at a perfect Age: He ſaw that his Food maintain'd Life, and he knew aſſuredly, that he had not taken any but very lately: How then could he attain to that Stature without that help? Or how was it that he found himſelf now ready to faint, if he deferr'd to take it, which formerly he had not felt the want of? Theſe Reflexions made it unqueſtionable to him that he was formed in a perfect Age.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, it was yet more eaſie for him to be perſwaded of the truth of God's Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forming of <hi>Eve,</hi> he needed but to count his own Ribs, and thoſe of his Wife, for he could not find one leſs in himſelf than in his Wife, without being fully ſatisfied in that Matter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Propoſitions, with many others of like nature, being ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> could be aſſur'd of the truth of, by making Reflexion either on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or on Plants, or living Creatures, greatly confirming his belief in the Divine Teſtimony, concerning his Creation, we may eaſily infer, that <hi>Adam</hi> could not deceive himſelf about that Matter.</p>

                     <p>WHen I take for granted, that <hi>Adam</hi> could ſatisſie himſelf concerning the truth of God's Revelation, by ſome natural and eaſie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, I don't find how any can think ſtrange of this Hypotheſis, except ſome, perchance, might think that I make <hi>Adam</hi> too Contemplative.</p>
                     <p>But if any will be pleas'd to make theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſervations, they will juſtifie me, that I have attributed nothing to him, but what agrees exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Character.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That <hi>Adam</hi> finding himſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his Creation, at his full and perfect Age, he was void of thoſe Prejudices, which the ignorance and weakneſs of his Infancy are the cauſe of; his Mind was not tainted with Popular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which oft are ſo great a hindrance to the knowledge of truth: He had not yet received any ill impreſſion; and when afterwards he was ſo credulous as to give way to a Temptation, his Experience prov'd a moſt powerful means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Reaſon, and withdraw him from his Error.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, we ſuppoſe here, that the Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, which acquainted him with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Circumſtances of his Creation, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Reflexions <hi>Adam</hi> made, and indeed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46528:39"/>was the cauſe of them. If we ſuppoſe ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man, not capable of diſcovering of himſelf, all on a ſuddain, the manner how ſuch a thing came to paſs, yet this is certain, that his Reaſon alone will be able to ſatisfie him, whether the thing happened in that manner which the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it imports, he needs but conſult the Rules of Probability to be determin'd in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> had not only the advantage of being formed at a perfect Age, of being acquainted by the Mouth of God himſelf, about the Creation of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of living ſo many Ages, which gave him leiſure enough to conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of what God had revealed to him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the grounds and certainty of it, and in a word, to judge whether the ſaid Reflexions were to be rejected as Fabulous, or to be relyed on as of moſt certain and evident truth: But over and above all this, <hi>Adam</hi> could rationally aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Manner how the things (which he had not ſeen) were done by the experience he had of other Matters, which were comprehended in the Divine Revelation.</p>
                     <p>The manner how his Body had been formed of the Earth, was, I confeſs, a thing difficult to be conceiv'd, but the production of an Infant like to himſelf, by the way of Generation, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was aſſured of by experience, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to confirm his mind in the belief of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation: The way of Generation, being at leaſt as much, if not more difficult to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as the manner of his Creation.</p>
                     <p>We have great reaſon to ſuppoſe, that as it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty, that ſo he did really make thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46528:39"/>Reflexions, I have attributed to him, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that God gave him a Law proportion'd to the ſtate in which he was Created: For this Law ſuppoſes that <hi>Adam</hi> own'd himſelf God's Subject; that he conſider'd God as his great Benefactor, that he hop'd for Rewards from him, and fear'd to be puniſh'd by him.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, If I ſhould grant that theſe Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did not at firſt make ſo deep an impreſſion in his heart, yet at leaſt, it cannot be deny'd, but that after his Fall, he was in a manner neceſſitated to meditate on theſe truths: God appeared to him in a viſible manner, God paſſed Sentence upon him, his Wife, and the Serpent; God condemn'd the Serpent, and afforded his Grace to Man; God made him a Promiſe proportion'd to the evil into which he was fallen. The Woman had deceiv'd her Husband, which did naturally tend to diſunite them, but God uniting himſelf again with <hi>Adam,</hi> made the effect of his Promiſe to depend upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s re-union with his Wife, having aſſured him, that the Offſpring of his Wife ſhould be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: God threatned the Woman with extream Pains in Child-bearing, he drave them out of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and placed a Flame of Fire to guard the entrance there.</p>
                     <p>All this without doubt, would never ſuffer <hi>Adam</hi> ſlightly to paſs over Matters of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as his Creation, and the manner of his being formed out of the Earth. Things being thus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is eaſie to judge whether we have ſuppoſed <hi>Adam</hi> too Subtil and Contemplative by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the foreſaid Reflexions to him.</p>

                     <p>IT is apparent, that as ſoon as the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> were arrived to years of underſtanding, they were in a condition to make Reflexions on the manner of their production, according to the information receiv'd of their Parents. They were able to compare the twofold Original of Man; the one, in which the Body was immediately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Earth; the other, in which it was produc'd by Generation, and were able to judge if either of them were improbable; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, whether the formation of their Parents, with other Matters conſequent, and depending on it, could be ſufficiently proved and confirm'd.</p>
                     <p>For it was eaſie for them to judge, that their Parents, of whoſe tenderneſs and care they had ſo great experience, could not have had the leaſt deſign to deceive them in what they had deliver'd to them concerning the Creation. They had alſo leiſure enough during the long Lives they enjoy'd, to examine the Solidity of thoſe Reaſons which perſwaded their Parents of the truth of their Creation.</p>
                     <p>For inſtance, they could eaſily inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether there were any more Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than their Father and Mother, that had been before them, whether they were produced from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46528:40"/>the Earth, or by a fortuitous concourſe of Atoms, whether there were any other Language beſides that which they ſpake? Whether there were any Ruins of Buildings, or other remains which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that Arts had been formerly Cultivated? And in a word, whether there were any reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that the World had not its beginning at the time which their Parents aſſigned for it?</p>
                     <p>Neither were they only in a condition to judge of the truth of theſe things, but their Senſes were able to convince them of it: As for inſtance, by ſeeing the firſt Trees, the production of others from them, and the different degrees of their growth.</p>
                     <p>But beſides all this, they could experience moſt of theſe things in their own Perſons, they could know whether God had aſſigned to Man the Fruit of Trees, and Grain for their Food, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> has recorded, only by examining their own Mouths, which were formed to chew Fruits, and not to tear the raw fleſh of Animals, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſharper and ſtronger Sets of Teeth, than thoſe they found themſelves provided with, the eating of fleſh not being introduced till after the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>Thus after the Act of Generation, they ſaw their Children Born, as it was repreſented to them, that they themſelves had been formed.</p>
                     <p>They had alſo before their eyes ſenſible ſigns of the truth of the Matters related to them: As for inſtance, the continual Miracle of a Flame of Fire, which kept them from entring into Paradiſe, was a certain Argument of the firſt ſin, of which they had not been Eye-witneſſes.</p>

                     <p>The Pains of a Woman in Child-bearing, did the more confirm the truth of the Divine Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, becauſe it was not obvious for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch Conſequences from an act which was pleaſing to their Senſual Appetites.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, Foraſmuch as they kept a Solemn day to Celebrate the Memory of the World's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, on which ſeventh day, their Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to them no leſs than two and fifty times a Year, the ſame thing, informing them of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Formation; 'tis impoſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they ſhould let theſe things paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any Reflexion on the truth of them, and the rather becauſe we cannot rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they ſhould have been ſerious in any Duties of Religion, without having firſt examin'd the truth of the Creation, and of the Promiſe of a Redeemer, which are the true Grounds of all Religious Acts whatſoever.</p>

                     <p>I ſay then, that they acted as thoſe who were fully aſſured of the truth of theſe Matters, which appears throughout the whole courſe of their Lives, not only when they did that which was good, but when they were overtaken with ſin: And this alone, methinks, is ſufficient to evidence the deep impreſſion, the belief of the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> had made on their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>Sacrifices are Acts of Religious Worſhip; and this Cuſtom therefore of Sacrificing, which we find amongſt the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> was an evident mark of their Piety; and this their Religious Inclination was, without doubt, the effect of their being perſwaded of the truth of the Creation, and firſt Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſin of <hi>Cain</hi> in killing his Brother, ſhews the ſame perſwaſion: The Divine Oracle, <hi>The Seed of the Woman, ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's head,</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:46528:42"/>being expreſs'd in very general terms, was applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either to the firſt Son of <hi>Eve,</hi> or to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; or elſe, to ſome other who might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Seed, becauſe born from one of her Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
                     <p>It is natural for us, to paſs from one meaning to another, when we are in ſearch for the true ſenſe of ſuch <hi>general propoſitions</hi> as theſe. Now it appears from the Name which <hi>Eve</hi> gave to <hi>Cain,</hi> that ſhe took the words of this Oracle in the firſt ſenſe, that is, ſhe looked upon <hi>Cain</hi> to be the Son that had been promis'd her, as appears from her own words.
<note place="margin">Gen. IV. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>gotten a Man from the Lord.</hi> And it cannot be doubted, that being in this Opinion her ſelf, ſhe was not wanting to cheriſh and flatter this hope in her Son, that he was to fulfil the firſt Prophecy or Divine Oracle: Neither is it any whit ſtranger to ſuppoſe this, than to imagine, that <hi>Mandane</hi> did inſtil into her Son <hi>Cyrus</hi> aſpiring thoughts for the Empire of <hi>Aſia,</hi> from the Dream of his Father <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> which ſhe look'd upon as a Divine foreboding.</p>
                     <p>When we read therefore, that <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing him preferr'd of God by a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing mark in the Act of their Sacrificing, through the jealouſie and hatred he had conceived againſt him: May we not very naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that as he had never doubted of the truth of the Promiſe, ſo he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee another come to diſpute his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of being the fulfiller of that firſt Oracle.</p>
                     <p>A like Reflexion we may make upon the Name which <hi>Eve</hi> gave to <hi>Seth,</hi> and indeed, the <hi>Jews</hi> in their antient Commentaries on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> lead us to

'Tis the King, the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I pretend not to maintain the Solidity of the Reflexions they make upon the words, <hi>Another Seed.</hi> They ſeem rather to have pleas'd themſelves in ſporting with a word which admits of both ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, <hi>other</hi> and <hi>strange,</hi> than to give us an exact and diſtinct notion of the importance of that word. Thus much at leaſt, we cannot deny, but that <hi>Eve</hi> conſidering her Son <hi>Seth,</hi> as him whom God had given her inſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> ſhe could do no leſs than acquaint him with her hopes; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this information was that which not only diſpoſed <hi>Seth</hi> and his Poſterity for Piety and the Spirit of Religion, but did alſo in a particular manner incline them to ſeparate from the Race of <hi>Cain,</hi> as from thoſe whom God had bereft of the right of fulfilling the firſt Oracle, to which naturally they might pretend.</p>
                     <p>It appears from the Example of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> lived in the exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip: And we know that the ſaid Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſuppoſeth the Creation of the World, and Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that all the Acts of Religion are employ'd either in Commemorating theſe Truths every ſeventh day, or in unfolding the Wonders therein contain'd, or in teſtifying our thankfulneſs to God for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>We may add here, that the inſtance of <hi>Lamech</hi>'s <hi>Polygamy</hi> does in ſome ſort make out to us the force of this perſwaſion.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:46528:43"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cain</hi> being rejected by God, and diſtinguiſh'd by an exemplary Puniſhment, for killing his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel,</hi> it is evident, that no man could any longer interpret that Promiſe in the firſt ſenſe, by applying it to <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Son, or his Poſterity. This being ſo plain, as none could be ignorant of it, it was therefore natural to ſeek for another meaning of that Promiſe, and to place the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in a Poſterity at a greater diſtance, or more numerous.</p>
                     <p>And indeed ſo it happen'd; for the Exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which God inflicted on <hi>Cain</hi> during the ſeven firſt Generations, according to thoſe words, That <hi>he ſhould be puniſhed ſevenfold,</hi> made his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity apprehend, that God (for the ſin he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) had juſtly debarr'd him of the right he might otherwiſe have had of fulfilling the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But yet at the ſame time they conceived alſo, that this Right, which belong'd more properly to the eldeſt or firſt-born, than to the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was now to return to his Poſterity after the ſeventh Generation. And in this view it ſeems, that <hi>Lamech</hi> affected Polygamy, as if by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his Poſterity, he had hoped to ſee that Promiſe fulfill'd by ſome one or other of them.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that he imitated the Crimes of <hi>Cain,</hi> and therefore may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have been leven'd alſo with his falſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims. But how greatly ſoever he was corrupted, yet foraſmuch as he had been educated in the hopes of his Father, and in converſe with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Seth,</hi> who many Ages before had formed Publick Aſſemblies for Religious Exerciſes, we can't well imagine, but that he muſt have had the ſame Pretenſions.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46528:43"/>
                     <p>It appears therefore, that the Polygamy of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> may juſtly be eſteemed an effect of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions concerning the ſence of the firſt Promiſe; thoſe means which he conceived moſt likely, he made choiſe of, to give him a ſhare in the fulfilling of that Promiſe, which pointed at a Son to be Born. So that the irregularity he was guilty of in Marrying two Wives at the ſame time, may paſs for a proof of his being perſwaded not only of the Promiſe, <hi>That the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould break the Serpent's Head,</hi> but alſo of the Creation of the World.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems, that according to theſe Principles, we may give a very plauſible account, as well of thoſe Violences which were exerciſed in the old World, and of their ſtrong Inclinations to ſenſuality, as of thoſe Alliances between the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> and that of <hi>Cain;</hi> which did not happen till ſeven Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after <hi>Cain;</hi> that is to ſay, at a time when the Family of <hi>Cain</hi> pretended to be reſtored again to his antient right, from which he had been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended during ſeven Generations: The Family of <hi>Seth</hi> by theſe Alliances with the Family of <hi>Cain,</hi> ſeeming deſirous to ſecure their hopes and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. It will not be thought ſtrange, that I look upon the Jealouſie of <hi>Cain</hi> towards his Brother (as thinking himſelf ſupplanted by him of his right to accompliſh the Promiſe) and the Polygamy of <hi>Lamech,</hi> as an effect of this perſwaſion; if it be conſider'd, that in all likelyhood this belief was more ſtrong at the beginning of the World, the Idea of the Promiſe being more freſh and lively in the minds of Men, as a thing at no great diſtance from thoſe times: And that we find in the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46528:44"/>in general, manifold inſtances of this Spirit of Jealouſie, and burning deſire of a Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>We find alſo, much about the ſame time, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lamech,</hi> the Father of <hi>Noah,</hi> declaring by the Name he gave his Son, the hopes he had that he might probably be the Perſon who was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Mankind concerning all the Miſery ſin had brought into the World.
<note place="margin">Gen. V. 29.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus it appears clearly, that for above ſixteen Ages from the Creation of the World to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, we find in all the actions of the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> a ſtrong impreſſion of the belief of the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And till this time we find not the leaſt inſtance which might ſeem to convince the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes</hi> of the leaſt Abſurdity. We ſee men acting from the perſwaſion of theſe two Matters of Fact; we muſt conclude therefore, that they were diſtinctly inform'd of them; yea, we ſee all men in general, acting according to this Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: it is evident therefore, they were known to all, and the weekly obſervance of the Sabbath day continually repreſenting thoſe Truths to the Eyes and Minds of all, takes away all poſſibility of Forgery in theſe Matters.</p>
                     <p>Let us now enquire whether after the Deluge theſe Ideas were effaced; or, whether they have not exerted the ſame efficacy in the Spirit of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Actions of all his Poſterity.</p>

                        <hi>That</hi> Noah <hi>was fully perſwaded of the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the</hi> Meſſiah.</head>
                     <p>IF we find that the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and their Poſterity, could be exactly informed of the Creation and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that indeed they were ſo, it will follow that <hi>Noah</hi> could not be unacquainted with the ſame Truths.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noah</hi> was ſix hundred Years old when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge came: He had Converſed with <hi>Lamech</hi> his Father, who had ſeen <hi>Adam</hi> and his Children, as being fifty ſix years of Age when <hi>Adam</hi> died; he had Converſed with <hi>Methuſalem</hi> his Grandfather, who died that very year the Flood came, and who being three hundred and forty three years old when <hi>Adam</hi> died, had without doubt inſtructed <hi>Noah,</hi> during ſo vaſt an interval of time, in like manner as himſelf had been inſtructed by <hi>Adam</hi> for many Ages.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Methuſalem</hi> had lived a long time with <hi>Seth,</hi> who died in the year of the World 1042, ſo it is evident, that <hi>Noah</hi> who was born in the year 1056, had not only ſeen <hi>Lamech</hi> and <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> but many alſo of their Anceſtors, whoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he heard, examin'd their Traditions, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their way of Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, <hi>Noah</hi> ſaw that there were no men in his time, who did not deduce their Genealogy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46528:45"/>from <hi>Adam.</hi> All his Contemporaries could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of it. Every one of them having as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a knowledge of their Anceſtors as he could have of his.</p>
                     <p>Now, that this was a matter which they might be eaſily aſſur'd of, appears on theſe two accounts: the one is the long life which the men of that Age enjoyed; and the other, the ſhort interval of time which was between the Creation and the Deluge, the whole amounting only to 1656 years. <hi>Adam</hi> died in the year 930, and the Deluge happened in the 600 year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Life. <hi>Adam</hi> died 126 years before the Birth of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo as <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have been ſeen and known by <hi>Methuſalem, Lamech,</hi> and thouſands of others who were Contemporarys with <hi>Noah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe we may add a third Remark, and that is the Jealouſie and Hatred which was between the two Families of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth: Cain</hi>'s Poſterity were altogether corrupted, and the greateſt part of <hi>Seth</hi>'s alſo: <hi>Noah</hi> being of the Poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> had no reaſon to call thoſe Matters in queſtion, which he ſaw generally own'd and received of thoſe to whom their Wickedneſs and Crimes ſuggeſted Objections againſt them. And I do not know, whether I might not ſuppoſe that <hi>Noah</hi> had before his eyes Paradiſe, with the Cherubims who guarded the entrance thereof, and made it inacceſſible, which if ſo, was an authentick proof of the Truths in queſtion: That Garden, as far as we can judge, being not deſtroy'd, nor the Guardian Angel diſcharged till the time of the Flood.</p>
                     <p>Be it as it will, yet <hi>Noah</hi> being a Man fearing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46528:45"/>God, was honoured with an extraordinary Call to exhort Men to Repentance, he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to build an Ark; he ſaw the Deluge happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to what God had foretold, he ſaw the Beaſts, of their own accord, gather themſelves together, to enter into the Ark, in like manner as he had been told that they came to <hi>Adam.</hi> He ſaw the Deluge ceaſe according to the Divine Declaration, he ſaw fire from Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Sacrifice he offer'd in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God, in like manner, as the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeem to imply, that it happened at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Abel.</hi> He ſaw himſelf choſen in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, to be the Depoſitary of the Promiſe which <hi>Adam</hi> had left to his Poſterity, tho he never had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing it fulfilled himſelf, God having reſerved the Accompliſhment of it for another time, and to one of his Poſterity at a great diſtance.</p>
                     <p>It is very evident, that all theſe Particulars could not but conduce to preſerve the Memory of theſe firſt moſt important Matters of Fact of the Creation and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and therefore, that <hi>Noah</hi> muſt of neceſſity be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the certainty and truth of them. Let us now ſee whether <hi>Noah</hi>'s Offſpring had the ſame perſwaſion concerning theſe things.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Children of <hi>Noah</hi> were an hundred years old when the Deluge happened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently had converſed a long ſpace of time with <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> and many other of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Relations of the old World, and had frequented the Religious Aſſemblies, obſerved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath day in the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> whence they were deſcended; and had been inſtructed there by thoſe who had ſeen <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity; it is evident therefore, beyond all conteſt, that they could not be ignorant of the Creation, and Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, that they had a diſtinct knowledge of thoſe Matters, we may evidently conclude, not only becauſe they had ſeen God, when he bleſſed them, and a ſecond time ſaid to them, as after a new Creation,
<note place="margin">Gen IX. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>increaſe and multiply:</hi> Nor only upon the account of his giving them a poſitive Law, forbidding them to eat the blood of living Creatures,
<note place="margin">Gen. IX 5.</note> whoſe fleſh they were permitted to feed on, as he had forbid <hi>Adam,</hi> to eat of the Fruit of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden, when he left the reſt to their free uſe: Not only, for that he had given the Rainbow, as a new ſign of his Covenant with Mankind; nor only becauſe they had practis'd thoſe Acts of Religion, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46528:46"/>which they had been Educated by their Parents and Anceſtors before the Deluge: But becauſe the ſame may be inferred from that action which drew upon <hi>Cham</hi> his Father's Curſe.</p>
                     <p>What is the meaning of <hi>Cham</hi>'s deriding the Nakedneſs of his Father, and of his Father's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion from thence to Curſe him ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and that in the perſon of <hi>Canaan</hi> his Firſt-born? If it were only a piece of irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Father, what reaſon had <hi>Noah</hi> to Curſe the Son on that account? Or, was it (as ſome have ſuppos'd) that <hi>Canaan</hi> had given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion firſt to his Fathers Irreverence, by acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with the diſorder in which he had found his Grandfather <hi>Noah?</hi> Without doubt, there is ſomething more than ordinary in this Hiſtory. Sure it is, that the account given us of <hi>Cham,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him as a prophane perſon, and deeply tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured with the Maxims of <hi>Cain</hi> and his Poſterity, and ſeems to hint to us, that he ſuppoſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> either fruſtrated by the Death of <hi>Abel,</hi> or altogether falſe, he made his Father's Nakedneſs the ſubject of his Mockery; who ſeem'd to be incapable of begetting any more Children, and therefore incapable of contributing to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in hopes of which, he accounted himſelf ſo happy, that he had eſcaped the Deluge.</p>
                     <p>What means it alſo, that <hi>Noah</hi> pronounceth ſo terrible a Curſe, againſt the Poſterity of <hi>Cham</hi> by <hi>Canaan,</hi> who were ſo far from giving an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment to that Promiſe, that they were in a manner wholly exterminated by <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> when God put the Poſterity of <hi>Shem</hi> by <hi>Abraham</hi> in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46528:47"/>poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> It is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for us to conceive, that <hi>Noah</hi> conſider'd his Son <hi>Cham</hi>'s deriding of him, not only as contrary to the reſpect which was due to him as his Father, but alſo as the effect of a horrid Impiety, which attack'd God himſelf, as making that Promiſe, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> a ſubject of Raillery.</p>
                     <p>This Reflexion upon the action of <hi>Cham,</hi> and the Curſe of <hi>Noah</hi> conſequent to it, does appear very natural, if we conſider that <hi>Noah</hi> could not but reflect upon the Name his Father had given him, and the ſpecial favour ſhewed to him, in being alone preſerved of all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently, the onely perſon in the World, by whom this Promiſe was to be fulfill'd.

                     <p>'Tis a thing worth our noting, that in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had ſo freſh a memory of <hi>Cham</hi>'s ſin,

                        <hi>Noah</hi> dying 350 years after the Deluge, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that his Death happened in the year of the World 2006; ſo that <hi>Noah</hi> died only two years

                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> lived 150 years with <hi>Shem,</hi> who died in the year 2158, and 88 years with <hi>Arphaxad</hi> the Son of <hi>Shem,</hi> who died in the year 2096, he lived 118 years with <hi>Selah</hi> Son of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> who died in the year 2126, and 179 years with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the Son of <hi>Selah,</hi> who died in the year 2187.</p>

                        <hi>Iſaac</hi> being born in the year 2108, might ſee <hi>Shem, Selah,</hi> and <hi>Heber,</hi> who for ſome hundreds of years had converſed with <hi>Noah</hi> and his other Children; I ſay we may ſuppoſe him to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with thoſe Patriarchs, or at leaſt with thoſe who being their Contemporaries, diſcourſed of <hi>Noah</hi> as a Man but of yeſterday, and from his Relation, and his Children's, were informed of the Creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> his Fall, the Promiſe of the Holy Seed, the Death of <hi>Abel,</hi> the Miracle of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, the Preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Deluge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And who, in obedience to the Law of God, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by their Anceſtors, did meet together fifty two times every year, to Celebrate the Memorial of theſe Wonders, and to teach them to their Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>We may take notice of three things here which conduce much to the preſervation of a diſtinct knowledge of theſe Matters.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Dea Syra</hi> p. 1060.</note> That the Ark it ſelf might be ſeen by all the World, as a certain Monument of the Deluge, and the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons. This Monument continued very many Ages after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and was a means to preſerve the Memory of the Deluge amongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> as <hi>Lucian,</hi> to name no more acquaints us.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:46528:48"/>
                     <p>The Second is, That it was as eaſie for any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Contemporaries, as for <hi>Abraham,</hi> to deduce his Genealogy from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>And this was the more eaſie, becauſe the firſt Diviſion of the World amongſt the three Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> was followed by another Partition amongſt their Poſterity, in the year of the World 1758, a Diviſion which gave them a juſt Title of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that part of the Earth, where they were ſeated, in defence of which, it ſeems probable, that the War of <hi>Chedorlaomer</hi> (mention'd the XIII of <hi>Geneſis</hi>) was undertaken, the Family of <hi>Cham</hi> having invaded the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was part of the Inheritance of <hi>Shem,</hi> as we ſhall make appear elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>The Third and laſt thing is, That it was not eaſie to impoſe a forgery upon thoſe times, becauſe their Lives were yet of a great extent, tho' inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to thoſe who lived before the Flood.</p>
                     <p>To theſe we may add this further Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as the Jealouſie which was between the Family of <hi>Seth</hi> and of <hi>Cain,</hi> was a great means to preſerve inviolably the important Truths of the Creation and firſt Promiſe; a like Jealouſie now being riſen amongſt the Sons of <hi>Noah, Cham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accurſed of his own Father in the perſon of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ſame being propagated to their Poſterity, it could not but effectually contribute to reſcue theſe important Truths from Oblivion, and particularly the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in theſe words, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:46528:49"/>
                     <p>In a word,
<note place="margin">Judg. VIII. 23. &amp; IX. 8. <hi>Talm. Hier.</hi> fol. 11 col. 4 <hi>&amp; gloſſ. in h. l. &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vodazara</hi> c. III. fol. 43. col. 1. <hi>De Dea Syr.</hi> p. 1069.</note> we may not only in reference to the matter in hand, take notice of what <hi>Lucian</hi> relates concerning the Religion of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which did ſo lively preſerve the memory of the Deluge, and of what was done to <hi>Noah</hi> by his Son <hi>Cham,</hi> when he ſcoffed at the Nakedneſs of his Father; but alſo, that the God of the <hi>Sichemites</hi> was called <hi>Baalberith,</hi> whoſe Symbol was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Privy parts of a Man, which ſeems a manifeſt alluſion to their deſcent from the Family of <hi>Cham,</hi> the <hi>Sichemites</hi> being ſome of the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo very natural to conceive, Firſt of all, that it was from thoſe old Pretenſions that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> took occaſion to prophane the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oly things, with ſuch ſhameful Idea's.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it was in deteſtation of theſe Idea's, that God ordered the killing of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That it was for the ſame reaſon, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to deſtroy them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This was alſo the reaſon why the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were ſo often deſirous of imitating their Crimes.</p>
                     <p>In the Fifth place, As we ſee that upon the like account the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> took <hi>Chemoſh</hi> for their God, and that the Women of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were very zealous to propagate their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which we have an Inſtance in <hi>Jezabel</hi> the Wife of <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo God was alſo willing to inſpire his People with Horrour and Deteſtation, for their Religion or any Alliance with them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As there does appear a very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46528:49"/>and reſemblance, between the firſt Birth of the World from the firſt Chaos, and its being born again after the Deluge; between <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man, and <hi>Noah</hi> the ſecond, and between the Jealouſies ſprung up in both their Families upon the account of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> So this conformity could not but very naturally contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, to preſerve the Memory of thoſe Ancient Events which <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Poſterity with all the care which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to preſerve the Tradition of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion.</p>

                        <hi>That we find the Family of</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Poſterity till</hi> Jacob <hi>fully perſwaded of thoſe Truths.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is no leſs eaſie to conceive how the diſtinct knowledge of theſe Truths, was in proceſs of time handed down to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity. This I ſhall briefly explain.</p>
                     <p>I need not take notice here, that the Religion practis'd by <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity ſuppoſe theſe Matters as conſtantly owned and known.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that <hi>Lot</hi> having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God called the latter out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> might thence ſuppoſe, that this Heavenly Call did ſeparate and diſtinguiſh him
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46528:50"/>from the reſt of the Poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> and gave him a right as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to pretend to the priviledge of fulfilling the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or at leaſt to ſee it fulfill'd in his Poſterity. This we may infer from the Inceſt of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Daughters; their Crime, which in another view appears very monſtrous, doth clearly prove, that they were ſtrongly poſſeſs'd with this hope which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had raiſed in them.</p>
                     <p>I know that ſome Interpreters ſuppoſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lyra</hi> in Geneſ. XIX.</note> that they were moved to commit this Inceſt from a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intention of preſerving Mankind, as imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, that as the Deluge had drowned all Men, beſides <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, ſo the Flames which deſtroy'd <hi>Sodom,</hi> had conſumed all Mankind; which they were the more ready to believe, becauſe they might have heard from their Father, that the World one day was to periſh by Fire.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bereſ. Rab.</hi> part 23.</note> But indeed, it may be conſider'd as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a very different Motive, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors plainly averring, that this was done by them in hopes of bringing forth the promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                     <p>And if we look upon this action of theirs in this view, with reference to the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> which was the grand object of the hopes of all thoſe that fear'd God; it is natural to conceive, that conſidering their Father, as one whom God had peculiarly choſen from amongſt the Poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> to execute the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſeeing that their Mother was changed into a Statue of Salt, they conceived themſelves in ſome ſort authoriz'd to ſurprize their Father in that manner; and the rather, becauſe they conceived on the one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46528:50"/>hand, that none of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> (upon whom God had now begun to pour forth ſo hideous a Vengeance, as a beginning of the Execution of the Curſe againſt <hi>Cham</hi>) having any part in this chiefeſt of Bleſſings, could ever Marry them, after that God had ſo manifeſtly ſeparated and call'd forth their Father from amongſt them; and on the other hand, ſuppoſing that God would diſpence with the irregularity of this action, by reaſon of their being reduced to an extremity.</p>
                     <p>There be three Circumſtances which greatly confirm this my remark upon the Motive of their Inceſt.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That they are repreſented to us as thoſe who had behaved themſelves very chaſtly, in the midſt of the Impurities of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and that beſides we find they deſign'd no ſuch thing, till after the Death of their Mother.</p>
                     <p>The other is, That we ſee them contriving the thing together, and that in a Matter which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is apt to ſeparate the greateſt Friends, where the Motive proceeds from a Spirit of uncleanneſs: Nor indeed, do we find that they continued in this Inceſt.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That they were ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſham'd of an action, in it ſelf ſo criminal, or concealing the knowledge of it from Poſterity, that they gave thoſe Names to the Children born of this their Inceſt, that might perpetuate and divulge the memory of this their action, the one calling her Son <hi>Moab,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Born of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the other hers <hi>Benammi;</hi> a Name of a like ſignification with the former.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation is very neceſſary, becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46528:51"/>theſe two Sons became the heads of two great Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms laſted above 1300 years, and lived on the Borders of the Holy Land, and were jealous of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, as pretending that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> could not be choſen before <hi>Lot</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who being the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to be conſider'd as the firſt-born of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and who were apt, without doubt, to take it for granted, that if God had brought <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and reſcued him from <hi>Ur,</hi> he had in a more peculiar manner, ſaved <hi>Lot</hi> alone from the Conflagration of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by the Miniſtry of Angels, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> being equally deſcended from <hi>Terah,</hi> the right of accompliſhing the Promiſe, did equally belong to them.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, we find that in all ſucceeding times, theſe thoughts did predominate with them, as may eaſily be made out from the Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee therefore, that the <hi>Moabites</hi> who were deſcended from the Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Lot,</hi> look'd upon the pretenſions of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was to be born of their Seed, in Excluſion to all others, with great impatience, and it was for this reaſon, that they ſent for <hi>Baladm,</hi> to decide (by Divine Authority) the difference between them, concerning the right of the promiſed Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p>We may make very near the ſame Reflexions upon the calling of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> when ſhe ſaith to <hi>Naomi</hi> her Mother-in-Law, <hi>Thy God ſhall be my God, and thy People ſhall be my People;</hi> which ſignifies a renouncing of the Pretenſions of her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46528:51"/>own People, and an acquieſcing in the Juſtice of thoſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and it was upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Ruth</hi> is more particularly taken notice of in the Genealogy of our Saviour, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
                     <p>That which I have hinted concerning the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aim of the Daughters of <hi>Lot,</hi> hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins, as we may ſee in the moſt ancient of their Commentaries upon theſe words of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Chap. XIX. v. 32. <hi>Come let us make our Father drink Wine,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which words, <hi>R. Tanchumah</hi> following the footſteps of <hi>R. Samuel,</hi> makes this Reflexion, <hi>That we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Seed of our Father;</hi> it is not ſaid, that we may preſerve a Son from our Father, but that we may renew the Poſterity of our Father, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they had regard to that Seed, which was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſtrange place, and what Seed is that? It is the King</hi> Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>After this Obſervation upon this action of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Daughters, it can no longer rationally be doubted, but that the violent paſſion which <hi>Sarah</hi> had for a Son, proceeded from the very fame impreſſion which made her contrary to the Inclinations of that Sex, to deliver her Servant into her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Boſom, eſpecially if we join to this the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſe God had made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which ſhe could not be ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sarah</hi> ſees her ſelf deſtitute of Children, and her Barrenneſs having continued ſo long a time, ſhe had no hopes of ever being a Mother, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd therefore for her, but to think of adopting a Son of her Bond-woman? And in conſideration of this, ſhe perſwades her Husband, who had no
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46528:52"/>inclination to any ſuch thing by any thing that appears (at leaſt precedent to this deſire of his Wife) to take her unto him. <hi>He ſought the Seed of God,</hi> that is, the Seed which God had promiſed, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Mal.</hi> II. 15.</p>
                     <p>At leaſt it is certain,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Yarg. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath.</hi> in h. l. <hi>&amp; Kimchi</hi> in h. l.</note> that the <hi>Jews</hi> have taken theſe words of <hi>Malachy</hi> in this ſenſe for a very long time, as they do ſtill to this day.</p>
                     <p>We may eaſily perceive, that this was a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant impreſſion throughout that whole Family, if to what we have already obſerv'd of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Daughters and of <hi>Sarah,</hi> we do but add the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Rebecca</hi> conceived becauſe of her Barrenneſs, and the Contentions happening between the Wives of <hi>Jacob,</hi> for their Husband's Company, without which ſuppoſal, the relation of ſuch a Matter, would be a thing of no importance.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, as it would be ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that ſo wiſe an Hiſtorian as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, ſhould ſtoop to the recital of ſuch mean and low particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (not to ſpeak worſe of them) without aiming at ſomething very high and conſiderable, ſo it is rational to believe, that in all theſe Relations, he pointed at the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which at that time was the great Object of the Religion of the Faithful, which God in proceſs of time did explain by little and little more diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>The Jealouſie alſo which aroſe between <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is no leſs conſiderable. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was the eldeſt Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Circumcis'd as well as <hi>Iſaac;</hi> he was ſaved from Death by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of an Angel; and was the head of a great People, who from that time to this very day, have always been Circumciſed.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:46528:52"/>
                     <p>It may be alſo of great uſe to take notice here, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> could not but be inſtructed by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> concerning the Promiſe God had made to him, to which he pretended, as being the Elder, and therefore mocked at the great ſtir was made at the weaning of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as thinking that he being the Eldeſt, could not be deprived of the natural right of his Primogeniture. At leaſt, it is very probable, that except it had been thus, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s anger (approved by God himſelf) would not have prov'd ſo violent, as well againſt <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as <hi>Hagar,</hi> who flatter'd him in theſe pretenſions, nor would <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo far have comply'd with it.</p>
                     <p>And foraſmuch, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> on the other ſide, was born to fulfil a particular Promiſe, was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and ſaved from death by an Angel; and that beſides all this, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and he had been equally educated in the practice of Religion, 'tis impoſſible, but that this Conformity of Events (which has been the cauſe of ſuch laſting Conteſts between them and their Poſterity) muſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them to inquire into the truth of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and into all other Matters which did any way concern them.</p>
                     <p>We have a like inſtance, if not ſtronger for our purpoſe, in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were both born of the ſame Mother, but <hi>Eſau</hi> being the firſt-born, we find the ſame Jealouſie ariſing between them, as before between <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac. Sarah</hi> ſeem'd ſomewhat cruel in caſting out her adopted Son <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and here we ſee that <hi>Rebecca</hi> preferred <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> before <hi>Eſau</hi> her Firſt-born, and aſſiſted him in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46528:53"/>robbing his Elder Brother of the Bleſſing due to him of right: But without queſtion, her deſign in all this was to entail this Bleſſing on her Family, by making it fall on <hi>Jacob,</hi> as being afraid (and that not without cauſe) that <hi>Eſau</hi> by his Sins and his Marriage with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf uncapable thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now as this was the occaſion of a great diſpute between theſe two Patriarchs educated in the ſame Belief and Religion, ſo it plainly ſhews us how ſtrong a perſwaſion they had of the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And beſides, it is further very remarkable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents <hi>Eſau</hi> as a prophane perſon, for which, not only this reaſon may be alledged, that he ſold his Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage, to which Birth-right the Prieſthood was always annexed, but we muſt further take notice.</p>
                     <p>That he being educated by his Father in the hopes of this Bleſſing, he ſeem'd to laugh at it in all his Actions; for firſt he Married the Daughter of <hi>Heth,</hi> by which he ſufficiently intimated, that he neither minded the Bleſſing nor the Curſe of God; for <hi>Canaan</hi> and his Poſterity had in a very ſolemn manner been Curſed by <hi>Noah,</hi> with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard to the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as I hinted before.</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, he Married a Daughter of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as if he intended to renew the Pretenſions of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> againſt <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father.</p>
                     <p>In the Third place we ſee, that when he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this prophane humor, he was pierced with extream ſorrow for the Crime he had committed, becauſe he could not obtain pardon for it.</p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:46528:53"/>
                     <p>This Jealouſie and difference between <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> is the more conſiderable, becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> was the head of a great Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> a People Circumciſed as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jealous of the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Borders of <hi>Judea,</hi> as well as the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> but yet put by their hopes by that Oracle, <hi>The greater People ſhall ſerve the leſſer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Were it needful to afford a greater Light to theſe Reflexions, I might here add a very natural one, from the Oath which <hi>Abraham</hi> made his Servant <hi>Eliezer</hi> take, when he ſent him to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> to procure a Wife for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> We may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge, that he was not willing he ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a <hi>Canaanite</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> had done; and that for fear of forfeiting his hopes, and weakening the juſt Pretenſions of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to the right of accompliſhing the Promiſe, from whence the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were excluded by the Prophecy deliver'd by <hi>Noah.</hi> But that which made <hi>Abraham</hi> to oblige his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſwear, putting his Hand under his Thigh; that is,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerom.</hi>
                        </note> touching that part which was the Subject of Circumciſion, and which bore the mark of the Covenant, deſerves a further Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>We find firſt of all, that the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> obſerves the ſame Cuſtom, when he made his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> to take an Oath, that he ſhould not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, We find that this Cuſtom of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Member which received Circumciſion, as a part Conſecrated to Religion, did by little and little take place in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave occaſion to the Worſhip of <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46528:54"/>among the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites;</hi> a very ſurpriſing and ſtrange Worſhip indeed, and yet Celebrated with Feſtivals, and Hymns, and was the riſe of that Worſhip which the Heathens after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave to <hi>Priapus.</hi> What I have here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hath been in part acknowledged by the <hi>Jews,</hi> where they ſpeak of the Worſhip of <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and the reaſon which made God preſcribe to the Prieſt the uſe of Linnen Drawers, that their Nakedneſs might not appear during the Functions of their Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>After all that I have now ſaid, concerning thoſe Jealouſies which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates with ſo much care, it ſeems that the Solidity of theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be diſputed. Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is theſe Jealouſies, and theſe Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that gave riſe to the Cuſtom of calling God, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> for tho' he might as well have been called the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the God of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and the God of <hi>Noah,</hi> foraſmuch as all theſe Patriarchs were alſo Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitaries of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> Yet it is probable that God was called ſo, becauſe of the particular promiſes which had been made firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſecondly to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in oppoſition to the pretenſions of ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near Neighbours to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and jealous of their hopes: The God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not of <hi>Lot,</hi> as the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites Lot</hi>'s Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pretended; the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and not of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> as the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> pretended; the God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and not of <hi>Eſau,</hi> as the <hi>Edomites</hi> who were the Offſpring of <hi>Eſau</hi> pretended.</p>

                     <p>IT is yet eaſier to ſhew; that the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creation, and of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> did continue from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Arguments will clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all,
<note place="margin">Geneſ. XXVIII.</note> we ſee that <hi>Jacob</hi> being poſſeſs'd of the Bleſſing, and ſo Depoſitary of the Promiſe, obey'd <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Command, who forbad him to take a Wife, but out of his own Family; and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he went to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> to ſeek and get a Wife amongſt thoſe of his Kindred, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had formerly ſent for one of the ſame Countrey for his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee in the Second place,
<note place="margin">Geneſ. XXIX.</note> this Patriarch imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Lamech</hi> in ſome reſpect, by his falling into Polygamy: For who can doubt but he, who was conſcious to himſelf of having ſurpriz'd, as he thought, the Bleſſing deſign'd for his Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did act in this occaſion by the ſame principle which <hi>Lamech</hi> had formerly acted by? Thus we ſee that Barren <hi>Rachel</hi> follows <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Example, and adopts the Son of that Maid Servant, whom ſhe gave to <hi>Jacob;</hi> wherein <hi>Leah</hi> follow'd her,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46528:55"/>and gave one of her Maids to her Husband: All this was evidently grounded upon the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which afterwards bred thoſe Diſſenſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives about the getting Children by him: For it is very natural to believe, that <hi>Jacob</hi> did not conceal from his Wives his advantages and hopes.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Children which were born, for the moſt part in <hi>Laban</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> where they had ſeen <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and thoſe of their own Kindred, from among whom God had commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to depart, and to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> did entertain very lively Notions of thoſe important Truths, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were ſtrengthened and confirm'd by the Cares and Inſtructions of old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to whom they were brought by <hi>Jacob;</hi> and after they began to practice in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Worſhip and Religion of their own Family, and to compare it with the Doctrine they had learnt in <hi>Chaldea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe ſeveral Voyages which God obliged the Patriarchs to undertake, as that of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Ur</hi> of <hi>Chaldea;</hi> that of <hi>Jacob</hi> out of <hi>Canaan</hi> (we ought to make the ſame judgement of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s forty years ſojourning amongſt the <hi>Midianites</hi>) did evidently oblige them to examine more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, what was the Tradition received in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries into which they travelled, and ſo to imprint the more deeply into their minds the belief of thoſe important Truths, which were the Foundation of their Religion. and the ſole object of the Meditations of the faithful.</p>
                     <p>One ſees in ſhort, the effects of theſe Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:46528:55"/>
                     <p n="1">1. By that Cuſtom which ſeems to have begun in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time, and which aftrrwards got the authority of a Law, I mean the cuſtom of taking to Wife ones own Brother's Widow to raiſe him up Seed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Sin of <hi>Onan</hi> is repreſented ſo odious, only becauſe by it, he acted againſt the belief of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſee the ſame thing in the action of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Juda</hi>'s Daughter-in-Law; for having been deceived by <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhe in exchange, ſurpriz'd him into an Inceſt, the Commiſſion whereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Obſervation of a Greek Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, ſhe ſought to perpetuate,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Theoph.</hi> in Mat. c. I.</note> only becauſe ſhe had a vehement deſire to get Children out of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which ſhe lookt upon as ſolely intruſted with the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and out of which he was accordingly to be born.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary to make that Obſervation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ought always to remember, that ſhe was formerly a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and that conſequently ſhe left off and renounc'd the Impiety and Idolatry of her Kindred, when ſhe embrac'd the Religion and hopes of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family. Therefore we ſee that particular mention is made of her in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Genealogy, and of <hi>Ruth</hi> who likewiſe gave over all the pretenſions of her own People, and ſo forſook her Religion to enter into the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as well as of <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> who was Wife to a <hi>Hittite;</hi> whereupon an ancient Father hath very well obſerved,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>S. Hieronym: in Tradit. Heb</hi> ad 1. Reg. 3.</note> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that <hi>Shimei</hi>'s Revilings againſt <hi>David,</hi> when he went out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> during <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Rebellion, reflected upon his Birth out of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46528:56"/>of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> even to this very day do underſtand it.</p>
                     <p>We may make the ſame Reflexion upon the Conſideration of that implacable jealouſie which <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dreams raiſed in the Minds of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We may reaſonably conceive, that he being the Firſt-born of <hi>Rachel,</hi> and the Wife which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> his Father had firſt made Love to, he had been brought up with hopes of the Birth-right, as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was but the ſecond Son of <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 2. He might beſides, very well ſuppoſe, that the Crimes of his Brethren born of <hi>Leah</hi> (whom in all likelihood he lookt upon as the ſole, Legitimate Heirs, the others being born of Maid-Servants) did rank them with <hi>Eſau,</hi> whom God had rejected. That outragious Fury which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren ſhew'd againſt him, becauſe they lookt upon him as preferred of God by thoſe Dreams to thoſe that were born before him, is ſo like that of <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and of <hi>Eſau;</hi> that it had, in all probability, the ſame Cauſe and Original.</p>
                     <p>Do we not ſee afterwards, another effect of the ſame jealouſie, in the affectation that <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family ſhew'd in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they refuſed to live promiſcuouſly with the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> which were the Poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> and begg'd of them a Countrey where they might live by themſelves; as we ſee on the contrary, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhewing an extream averſion againſt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and his Family, which was of <hi>Sem</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:46528:56"/>
                     <p>Certainly it cannot be denied, that as this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was an effect of the Antipathy of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo it might alſo be in ſome reſpect, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Childrens pretenſions upon the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the execution and accompliſhment whereof, they ſtood up for as belonging to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>To all this we may add, that the Perſecution of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> obliged them to make particular Reflexions upon the Promiſe which <hi>Jacob</hi> on his Death-Bed made to them from God: That Perſecution was chiefly intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Male Children, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanding the extirpation of them, becauſe he was afraid of the <hi>Jews</hi> growing too ſtrong for him, and of their joyning with his Enemies; and perhaps alſo, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> entertaining a certain expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s coming, and ſo boaſting and glorying of it upon all occaſions, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to fruſtrate, and cut off their hope thus, by hindering the accompliſhment of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>However there was no real difficulty to keep up the diſtinct remembrance of thoſe important Facts. <hi>Jacob</hi> died in the year of the World, 2315. <hi>Joſeph</hi> died in the year of the World, 2428. There are then but 58 years between <hi>Joſephs</hi> Death, and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Birth: <hi>Moſes</hi> might have ſeen not only <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>And it is for that reaſon,
<note place="margin">Gen. L. 23.</note> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have obſerv'd, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaw his own Children's Children; that is to ſay, the third Generation.</p>
                     <p>One cannot imagine any Circumſtances more conducible than theſe, to the preſerving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

                     <p>Thoſe Characters of time which <hi>Moſes</hi> hath ſo carefully obſerved, do plainly evidence, that the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> might be diſtinctly known: For if we ſuppoſe a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46528:57"/>ſucceſſion of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offſpring, it was not eaſie to impoſe upon Men in that matter; and that, becauſe every one of thoſe who were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries with <hi>Moſes,</hi> being able to run up his own Pedigree as far as the Flood, nay, even up to <hi>Adam,</hi> by as compendious a way as <hi>Moſes</hi> could do his own; they would have treated thoſe with the utmoſt degree of ſcorn, who ſhould have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to forge any thing contrary to what was publickly and univerſally known; and ſo it was equally impoſſible, that the truth of things ſo important as the Creation, and the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were, ſhould be unknown.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I think I have plainly ſhew'd, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actions recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> tho' very ſtrange in themſelves, and which the Atheiſts look upon as abſurd and ridiculous, have proceeded from no other principle than from the ſtrong perſwaſion of the truth of thoſe Facts, according as in a long Series of Ages, every one of the Ancients follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own humour and prejudices, framed to himſelf a particular Idea differing from the true ſenſe of the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot reaſonably be objected, that all this is only grounded upon the uncertain authority of Tradition: For tho' I grant that Tradition, as to Facts of another nature, be dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and not to be too much relyed upon in matter of Belief, yet this hath ſuch very particular Characters as keep up its own authority.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it ſuppoſeth a ſmall number of perſons from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who put it in Writing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It ſuppoſeth, that thoſe who have preſerved this Tradition, lived very long, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46528:58"/>for the moſt part, for many Centuries of Years.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It relates to ſuch Facts as every one is deſirous to be rightly inform'd of, and which he is particularly concern'd to examine, as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his own private Intereſt, becauſe they are the Principles of his Actions, and the rules of his Conduct both in Civil and Religious Matters.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it ſuppoſeth ſuch real Marks as ſerved to keep it up; ſuch as the pains of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, the Paradiſe before the Flood, the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ark after the Flood.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It ſuppoſeth a Publick Service and Worſhip, whoſe Celebration is repeated fifty two times a year, that the remembrance of it ſhould be preſerved by all Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It was preſerved entire by paſſing from Father to Son, and we know that Fathers or Mothers do not naturally engage in a Deſign of deceiving their Children.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, It ſuppoſeth ſtrange Controverſies betwixt Brothers, the Elder having almoſt all been excluded, and the younger, as <hi>Abel, Seth, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Juda,</hi> choſen to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which bred great Jealouſies, and tended much to preſerve thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of the truth.</p>

                        <hi>An Explication of</hi> Moſes<hi>'s way of Writing; where it is ſhew'd, that in writing the Book of</hi> Geneſis, <hi>he mentioned nothing but what was then generally known.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is a truth which at firſt I took for granted, and afterwards proved it, the reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I explained particularly as I went on. But it ought to be fixed as ſolidly as the Matter will bear, becauſe it often happens, that thoſe who do not foreſee the Conſequences which may be drawn from the contrary Opinion, do contradict it before they are aware of it; and that too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of exalting the Divine Authority of the Book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> which gives occaſion to the Atheiſts to look upon it no otherwiſe than as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men do, on the greateſt part of Legends.</p>
                     <p>The Prophetical Spirit acts in two manners.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is by way of Revelation, in reſpect of thoſe things the Prophet hath no knowledge of.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46528:59"/>Thus the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> hath foretold thoſe Events, which we read of in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> For thoſe Events being all hidden under the ſhadows of Futurity, it was impoſſible for him to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them, unleſs the Spirit of God had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately revealed them to him.</p>
                     <p>The Second is by way of direction, in reſpect of thoſe things with which the Prophet was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted, either becauſe he was an Eye-Witneſs of them himſelf, or becauſe he learnt them from thoſe who were ſo.</p>
                     <p>Now this direction of the Spirit conſiſts in the guiding the Prophets ſo as that he may write of his Subject, juſt as it was either ſpoken or done. Thus the Evangeliſts St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> drew up an Abridgment of thoſe Sermons of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which they had heard, and of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they had ſeen.</p>
                     <p>And thus St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of thoſe things which they had heard from thoſe that were Eye-Witneſſes of them, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> particularly tells us.</p>
                     <p>Now I affirm, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he had only the ſecond ſort of Prophetical Influences, and not the firſt; Although in our Diſputes againſt Atheiſts, to convince them by Arguments from Matters of Fact, we may conſider him only as an Hiſtorian, who might have written his Book without any other particular direction, and might have preſerved in it the memory of thoſe ancient Events which were then generally known.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſide ſoever Divines may take in their Diſputes againſt the Atheiſts, I may eaſily
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46528:59"/>eſtabliſh my Aſſertion: Firſt, becauſe it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſuppoſe an entire Revelation, where Tradition being diſtinct enough, is ſufficient to preſerve a clear Remembrance of all thoſe Facts.</p>
                     <p>Now it cannot be denied, but that the Tradition concerning the Creation and the Promiſe of the Meſſiah was of this nature, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the little Extent of it, and the immediate Succeſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Anceſtors, down to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Travels through ſo many places, were, as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already, very uſeful to give them a further view of the common belief of all the ſeveral Nations deſcended from <hi>Noah,</hi> and of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in this Tradition, it were unjuſt to ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s forty years ſojourning in the Country of <hi>Midian,</hi> and that too when he was forty years old, and conſequently had that ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Age and Judgment as is fitteſt for ſuch Obſervations, did not ſerve to acquaint him with the ſeveral Paſſages he records of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as of the ſeveral Diviſions of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve in the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> a way of writing very different from that which we ſee in the greateſt part of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and in the following Books; for whereas God ſpeaks to him in thoſe latter Books, which he always did <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> (And the <hi>Jews</hi> have wiſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that herein conſiſted <hi>Moſes</hi>'s advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the other Prophets to whom God was uſed to ſpeak only in Dreams and Viſions) He uſes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46528:60"/>commonly thoſe words, <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto me.</hi> He marks out the place where God ſpoke to him, as well as the time and occaſion of God's ſpeaking to him, which he do's not in his Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is not divided into ſeveral Revelations, as all Prophecies are, wherein the ſeveral returns of the Holy Spirit of God are all exactly ſet down; which was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, not only to eaſe the Reader, who might be tired, if he was to carry a long Series of Predictions in his mind at once, as if it were only one ſingle Viſion or Revelation; but alſo to condeſcend to the nature of the minds of men: For according to the Rules of probability, we cannot ſuppoſe them to be filled with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny differing Idea's at the ſame time, but a great confuſion muſt neceſſarily follow.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing that theſe Obſervations ſhould be thought inſufficient, yet thoſe that follow will ſeem capable of convincing the minds of all. There are in the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> certain Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of its being written in that way which I ſpake of. Firſt, one needs only juſt look into that Book, and he will ſee that the ancienteſt Facts, which are thoſe of which we moſt deſire a particular account, are there deſcribed in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort and conciſe manner. The Hiſtory of 1656 years is all contained in Eight Chapters; There are no Actions deſcribed therein with more Circumſtances, than only ſome few of the moſt important, the remembrance whereof was ſtill freſh amongſt them. The Hiſtory of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi>'s Polygamy, and the Murders of which he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46528:60"/>was guilty, is there ſet down ſo compendiouſly, that it is very obſcure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, One ſees that he ſpeaks more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of all that had been tranſacted near his time: He explains and mentions all the particulars and circumſtances thereof. He ſpeaks ſo ſhortly of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> that it is doubted to this day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not the Patriarch <hi>Sem,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithful worſhipper of the true God ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> whereas he ſets down at length all the particulars of the Hiſtory of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe laſt Oracles which he ſpoke on his Death-bed, he carefully records.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He deſcribes with the ſame exactneſs all the Genealogies of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> their ſeveral Tribes, and the Names of their Heads and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As when he ſpeaks of thoſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which indeed he could eaſily do, having liv'd forty years of his life amongſt thoſe Nations, as well as he had other forty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who maintain the contrary Opinion, muſt of neceſſity ſuppoſe, Firſt, That Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of no uſe at all to preſerve the Idea of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illuſtrious Action.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time there were none who knew any particulars of the Hiſtory of the Flood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> of the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tongues; tho' we ſee plainly, both by the nature of the Facts themſelves, in which all Nations were concern'd, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that the generality of Mankind were ſufficiently inſtructed in them already.</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:46528:61"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, It muſt be ſuppoſed that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath ſet down the manner how that Tradition was infallibly preſerved ſo carefully to no purpoſe, tho' he took notice of all the Circumſtances ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for that effect.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They muſt ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes,</hi> whilſt he ſojourned in the Land of <hi>Midian,</hi> heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either of their Original and Pedigree, nor yet of the other neighbouring Nations who were deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> altho' all theſe Nations valued themſelves upon their being deſcended from that Patriarch, and kept up their ſeveral Pedigrees, by which they could trace their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal with the ſame care as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did theirs, becauſe they had the ſame pretenſions that the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> had.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We muſt abſolutely take away the Authority of the Oracles recorded by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Theſe Oracles promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> the poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and threaten the <hi>Canaanites</hi> with ſeveral Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Will bequeathed <hi>Sichem</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> He expreſly marks out the Country which one of the Tribes was to poſſeſs; he gives a deſcription of the Character and Rank of every Tribe. The accompliſhment of thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, tho' never ſo exact and admirable, is of no manner of conſequence, if we ſuppoſe that theſe particular Predictions were abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, whereas their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, which he carefully deſcribes from time to time, is the moſt ſolid demonſtration which can be deſired, to eſtabliſh the Divinity of thoſe Revelations, as well as of <hi>Moſes</hi> his other Books.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHat I have already repreſented is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> writ nothing in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but what was then generally known by all the World. And I know nothing that can be objected with any probability, but what we read in the moſt ancient Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> Hiſtory, and in the Modern ones concerning that of <hi>China.</hi> We muſt then examin both the one and the other with attention, that we may leave no Difficulties in ſo important a Subject.</p>
                     <p>All that the Atheiſts can object againſt the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Creation of the World as he hath fixed it, is what <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> relates, that in the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, there were ſome <hi>Egyptians</hi> that reckon'd up Three and twenty thouſand years from the Reign of the Sun to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time, and that thoſe who reckon'd leaſt, yet reckon'd ſomewhat more than Ten thouſand years, which account exceeds the Antiquity which <hi>Moſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to the World in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> by many Ages, where he repreſents the Creation as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46528:62"/>a Fact which happened ſome few years more than Two thouſand five hundred before he wrote that Book. How then did <hi>Moſes</hi> write of things univerſally acknowledged by all the World? And they may here further aggravate, what the ſame <hi>Diodorus</hi> hath obſerved, That the Hiſtory of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was not written like that of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> amongſt whom, thoſe who came firſt wrote their own Hiſtories, every man according to his own private humour, which cauſed that great variety amongſt their Hiſtorians: whereas amongſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> none wrote but by publick Authority; the Prieſts alone having that particular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſerved for them to write their Hiſtories in their ſeveral Generations.</p>
                     <p>This Objection is eaſily confuted in two words: In ſhort, How could the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have always had men to write their Hiſtories by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all their ſucceeding Generations, ſeeing there were; as <hi>Diodorus</hi> obſerves, ſuch a ſtrange and vaſt Diviſions amongſt themſelves? If there were but two or three Ages difference more or leſs, no body would look upon it, as a material Exception againſt the Hiſtory of ſuch a long Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of time; But who can imagine that thoſe men who differ no leſs than Thirteen thouſand years in their Accounts of the Duration of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of time, had yet certain Hiſtories upon which theſe things were grounded.</p>
                     <p>This ſhews ſufficiently, that as <hi>Varro</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Scholar the <hi>Romans</hi> ever had, hath divided Antiquity into Fabulous and Hiſtorical, which he begins from the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> leaving all which went before to the fabulous part; ſo we
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46528:62"/>muſt of neceſſity make the ſame diſtinction in the Matter of the Antiquities of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I intend to do ſome thing more, and to conſider this <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiſtory with a little more attention; out of which, I think, I may draw good Arguments to confute the vanity of thoſe Paſſages in it oppoſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to confirm the Authority of his Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the truth of the chiefeſt Tranſactions recorded in it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not at preſent take notice, that altho' the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> about their latter times, have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the Elements were eternal, yet they have ſufficiently acknowledged that the World had a beginning, ſeeing they make no mention of any thing before their thirty Dynaſties, which in all, did at the moſt amount to no more then 36525 years.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I think neceſſary to mention here that they have ſufficiently acknowledged the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Mankind, ſeeing they held that men were firſt born in <hi>Egypt;</hi> altho' they endeavoured to make good their pretenſions by that ſottiſh Aſſertion of the eaſie production of Frogs out of the mud of their Fen's, as the ſame <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us.</p>
                     <p>But there are three things which I muſt here take notice of, becauſe they do moſt certainly decide the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That by that long Reign which they aſcribe to their Gods and Hero's, there is nothing elſe meant but the motion of the Stars, and nothing like a real Kingdom. That prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous number of years does not relate to the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, as if it had ſubſiſted ſo long;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46528:63"/>but to the return of the Sun, and the Moon, and the five other Planets, and of the Heavens, to the ſame point from whence, according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they firſt began their Courſe: In a word, it is only the great Aſtronomical Year, about which, as <hi>Ariſtole</hi> tells us, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have had ſo many different Opinions, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have ſo little agreed, as the Hiſtory of their Antiquities, related by <hi>Diodorus,</hi> plainly ſhews. One thing evidently-proves what I here alledge, which is, that they have reckon'd up but fifteen Dynaſties to <hi>Jupiter</hi> the laſt of the Heroes, that is to ſay, but fifteen perſons to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is <hi>Ham</hi> the third Son of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This comes very near <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Calculation, who reckoneth <hi>Noah</hi> as the tenth man from <hi>Adam:</hi> for it is very likely, that thoſe ignorant people, after a long proceſs of time, have joyned <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> with <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> and <hi>Miſraim</hi> the Son of <hi>Ham,</hi> which makes up the ſixteen Dynaſties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we chuſe to ſay that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought fit to joyn the ſeven Generations of <hi>Cain</hi> to thoſe before the Flood, which comes very near to the ſame Account. All this, according to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Notions of thoſe ancient people, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the firſt men, and gave them afterwards the Names of ſome Stars, to impreſs upon their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity a greater veneration for them; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, according to the groundleſs imagination of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were reſolved to maintain that the firſt men were formed in their own Country. And in ſhort, we find that thoſe Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſties for the moſt part, if we except thoſe of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and of the Sun, have been but of a very
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46528:63"/>ſhort continuance, and even ſhorter than that which <hi>Moſes</hi> aſcribes to the lives of the ancient Patriarchs, which we have already ſet down.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing that is obſervable in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of this falſe Antiquity, if one would take what the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have related of their Dynaſties before <hi>Menes,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> the laſt of their Heroes in a Hiſtorical ſenſe, is, that there are ſtill ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent marks of the newneſs of the World, as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath deſcribed it, in the remaining Fragments of the true <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We ſee that <hi>Egypt</hi> hath conſtantly carried the Name of <hi>Ham</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as in the Holy Scriptures. It was called ſo in <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s time: The <hi>Egyptian Thebes</hi> was called <hi>Hammon No Ezech.</hi> 30. which is the Name of the <hi>Egyptian Jupiter,</hi> as the Heathen Authors <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſtifie. Now it is viſible, that all this was for no other reaſon, but becauſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> had fallen to the ſhare of <hi>Ham, Noah</hi>'s third Son, who ſettled there, and whoſe Poſterity did afterwards people <hi>Africa,</hi> and gave it their ſeveral Names, as <hi>Moſes</hi> particularly obſerves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, One ſee's that <hi>Egypt</hi> hath more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly born the Name of <hi>Mizraim,</hi> which it bares ſtill, and which was given to it, in reſpect of one of its parts, becauſe of <hi>Mizraim</hi> the Son of <hi>Ham.</hi> And it would be ridiculous for one to imagine that thoſe Characters given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of in the World, except he had had good grounds to deſcribe their original in the ſame manner as he hath already done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, One ſee's that all the Dynaſties of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> that is to ſay, all the ſeveral Branches of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46528:64"/>Kings who have reign'd over the ſeveral parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did all acknowledge <hi>Menes</hi> for their Common Founder.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Menes</hi> being the ſame with that <hi>Mizraim</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter; It is viſible that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who in all likelyhood have aſcribed to <hi>Menes</hi> what they might more juſtly have aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> becauſe they would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh their Kings from Hero's, have exactly followed the Idea's of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in repreſenting one as the common Father of all the ſeveral Branches of Kings who divided <hi>Egypt</hi> amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, One ſee's that the Invention of the Arts moſt neceſſary to Human Life, have been attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either to <hi>Menes</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or to his Succeſſors. It was this <hi>Menes,</hi> or one of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who invented Laws, Letters, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Muſick, Wreſtling, Phyſick, Hieroglyphicks, Anatomy, and Architecture. All this plainly ſhews that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had been miſtaken, if they had aſcribed to the World as great an Antiquity as one would think they did, by the vaſt extent of time which they aſcribed to the Dynaſties of their Gods and Hero's. How could the World have continued above Thirty thouſand years without thoſe Arts which are ſo neceſſary for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Human Life? How could men not have found out, during ſuch a prodigious ſucceſſion of Ages, thoſe Arts, the invention whereof the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> do aſcribe to their firſt King, or to one or two of his Succeſſors, during a very ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, One ſee's in the Hiſtory of <hi>Egypt</hi> the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46528:64"/>ſame decay in Religion that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of.

                           <hi>Herod</hi> Lib. II. cap 4. <hi>Lucian</hi> de Dea Syr.</note> The Ancients unanimouſly agree that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had at firſt neither Statues nor Images in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which perfectly agrees with what <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us of the times after the Flood: But they tell us alſo, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> afterwards made ſome Statues, and conſecrated in their Temples the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of great numbers of Animals. Some are of opinion, and that probably enough, that this came from the belief which they entertained afterwards of the Tranſmigration of Souls into other Animals, an opinion which they thought did neceſſarily flow from the Doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, However, one ſees in the ſixth place, That as <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents <hi>Nimrod</hi> one of <hi>Ham</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as the Founder of an Empire in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> where he formed the manners of the Inhabitants according to the Platform of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſo the Ancients have obſerved, That the famous <hi>Aſſyrian Belus</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> And it is natural to conceive,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pauſan.</hi> in <hi>Meſſen</hi> p. 261.</note> that there he planted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which began even before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; If it be true as the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerve, that the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> was a Temple wherein an Idol was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to worſhip him. At leaſt, that conjecture hath a very ſolid ground, if we conſider the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> towards this <hi>Bel,</hi> whom they worſhipped as a God, according to the Pagans Cuſtom of Adoring the Founders of Kingdoms after their deceaſe as Gods.</p>
                     <p>The third thing we are here to take notice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Demonſtration of the Truth of the Book <hi>Geneſis,</hi> if that which is recorded in it concerning the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46528:65"/>time of the Flood, be compared with the Dyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings. I will not ſay that thoſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who had any knowledge of the Flood, did exactly mark out the time of it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth. But I believe I may be able to ſhew out of their common opinion's, ſomthing very near equivalent.</p>
                     <p>They are all agreed that <hi>Menes</hi> was the firſt King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and lived about Fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the famous <hi>Seſostris,</hi> as <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> do both relate it: Now, who ſhould this King of <hi>Egypt</hi> be, whom ſome call <hi>Seſonchoſis,</hi> unleſs he is the ſame with <hi>Shiſhak</hi> whom the Scripture ſpeaks of in the Hiſtory of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings XIV. 26.</note> even the ſame famous Conquerer who took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the fifth year of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Reign. If one calculates the time from the Flood, to the fifth year of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> he will find that this <hi>Menes</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is no other than the <hi>Ham</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and on the other ſide, that there is very little difference in reſpect of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of time betwixt the Chronology of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and that of the Scriptures? Thus the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Account confirms <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Narrative, and the Authority of the Holy Writers, who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular in ſtating the times of every thing: whereas the <hi>Egyptians</hi> taking all in great, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrive at that exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation is of very great uſe, to ſhew the certainty of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chronology according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text: For that of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons up above two thouſand years, from the Flood to <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> whereas the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did reckon up but a little above fourteen hundred years from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46528:65"/>
                        <hi>Menes</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Seſoſtris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is yet leſs difficulty to anſwer the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which may be made againſt the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> from the pretended Antiquity of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans.</hi> The ſame <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who ſaith,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diodor.</hi> l. 2. Sect. 30, 31.</note> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> propoſed ſo great an Antiquity of the World, tells us alſo, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it eternal, and that they boaſted in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s time, that they had learnt Aſtronomy by Tradition from their Anceſtors, who had all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively made it their ſtudy for four hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty two thouſand years together. But there is nothing vainer than theſe Pretences.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not ſtand to ſhew here the folly of their Opinions about the Eternity of the World: If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to have authoriz'd it, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to confute that Opinion, to conſider, that it is repugnant to the common notion of all the Nations of the World: So that <hi>Democritus</hi> himſelf, who pretended that the World was made by chance, yet durſt not oppoſe the common and general Opinion of the Worlds being new, tho' he had the boldneſs to reject the Author of it, and that action by which it was Created.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I intend to be prolix here in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the ſuppoſition of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> about their Anceſtors following the Study of Aſtrology for 472000 year ſucceſſively: The impoſſibility of the thing in it ſelf is apparent by the certainty of the Flood, which was acknowledged by all thoſe Nations, of whom we have any Antiquities, tho' never ſo little conſiderable in <hi>Pagan</hi> Authors.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall make two Obſervations, whereof one ſhews the folly of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Hypotheſis, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46528:66"/>the other doth invincibly eſtabliſh the Authority of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> if it be compared with what we know for certain, and in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That the moſt Ancient Authors are of Opinion, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are deſcended from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who lookt upon them as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of their own. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> maintained, that they had ſent out ſeveral Colonies into ſeveral parts of the World; that <hi>Belus</hi> the Son of <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Lybia</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted one into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that having fixed it near <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he eſtabliſh'd ſome Prieſts among them according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Cuſtom, who were free from all publick Charges and Offices, whom the <hi>Babylonians</hi> do call <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and who according to the Example of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ap. Joſeph. Antiq.</hi> l. 1. c. 5. <hi>Pauſan. Meſſen.</hi> P. 261.</note> Philoſophers, and Aſtrologers, did apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the obſervation of the Stars. <hi>Heſtiaeus,</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> ſay the ſame with <hi>Diodorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now one needs only examine here, what the <hi>Egyptians</hi> do ſay about the invention of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> which they aſcribe to <hi>Menes,</hi> that is to ſay, to <hi>Ham,</hi> or to <hi>Mizraim,</hi> who lived after the Flood, thereby to diſcover the Fooliſh Vanity of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is plain, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> grew ſo vain, by the growth of ſo conſiderable an Empire as theirs was, that they would be no longer beholding to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Aſtrologers, whom all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have lookt upon as the firſt Inventors of that Science, to the inventing and perfecting of which, all Men know that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Climate, where the Skie is always free from Clouds, did very much contribute.</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:46528:66"/>
                     <p>And it is very conſiderable, that both the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> began their Year with the ſame Month, according to <hi>Cenſorinus</hi>'s Obſervation, c. XXI. <hi>de die Nat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know very well, the Ancient Heathens were miſtaken when they pretended, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a Plantation: There is, no doubt, a kind of Illuſion in this their Opinion; but yet the ground and Origine of it is uncontroulable, becauſe the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are deſcended from <hi>Cuſh, Ham</hi>'s Eldeſt Son, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells, <hi>Gen.</hi> X. Therefore tho' we ſhould grant, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were the firſt Inventors of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, yet this would be always certain, that it was found out only ſince <hi>Ham</hi>'s time, whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did look upon as the laſt of their Heroes, or as the firſt of their Kings.</p>
                     <p>The other Obſervation which ought to be well minded here, is taken out of the true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <hi>Chaldean</hi> Antiquities. One may prove by the Aſtronomical Demonſtrations of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, that <hi>Moſes</hi> followed a Calculation which was then generally known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the firſt <hi>Grecian,</hi> that ever taught the Eternity of the World, contrary to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the Man who furniſhes us with it. He took care to ſend over into <hi>Greece</hi> the Aſtronomical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> by which it appeared,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Simplic.</hi> in l. 2. <hi>de coelo.</hi>
                        </note> that <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by <hi>Alexander</hi> about 1903 years after its Foundation. Now that Calculation agrees exactly with that of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. XI.</note> who gives us the Deſcription of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Original of the Name of that City,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46528:67"/>which was built ſome Ages after, by the Confuſion of Tongues which then happened. And truly, it would be very admirable, that the Heavens in their Motions ſhould have entered into a Confederacy with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to juſtifie a Chronology invented by him in ſport, without keeping to any Rules, but writing by chance, and without any certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>

                        <hi>An Anſwer to the Objection which may be drawn out of the Hiſtory of</hi> China, <hi>againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Hypotheſis, concerning the newneſs of the World.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Come now to the other Objection which may be made againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Calculation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, as we have it now. It is drawn from the Hiſtory of <hi>China,</hi> whoſe uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Series runs up the Succeſſion of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors to <hi>Fobius</hi> who Reign'd about four hundred years before the Flood. Some Learned Men have already made uſe of that Argument, to diſcredit the Moſaick Chronology according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and to cry up the Calculation of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, which exceeds that of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46528:67"/>in the Hiſtory before the Flood, by 800 years, and above 700 in the Hiſtory from the Flood to <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Objection appears very ſtrong to thoſe who read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Martinius,</hi> that there is not the leaſt interruption in the Catalogue of the Kings of <hi>China</hi> from <hi>Fobius;</hi> that the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their actions is ſo certain, having always been written by a Publick Authority, that no Man can reaſonably entertain any doubt about it: And the Miſſionaries in <hi>China,</hi> have thought that there was no other way to reconcile the Moſaick Chronology, with the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> but in making uſe of the Septuagint's Account; and wherein they agree with all the Aſiatick Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and even thoſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> who follow the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in their reckoning up the years of the World, for the moſt part: Though St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Tranſlation, which follows the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, is received in the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>But after all, there is little difficulty in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Objection, and we may hereupon eaſily ſatisfie, thoſe who do not diſpute only for diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſake, but are ready to examine this Queſtion, with that equity which is requiſite in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all Queſtions of that nature.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs ingeniouſly, that this Hiſtory, which is one of the moſt ancient in the World, hath many Illuſtrious Characters of certainty, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we give credit to all that <hi>Martinius</hi> relates of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It marks out exactly the Series and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> from the very beginning and original of that Nation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It records in what Year of each Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46528:68"/>of threeſcore years, every King began his Reign and did ſuch or ſuch an action.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It relates ſome Aſtronomical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, older than any that have been made by the moſt Ancient Aſtronomers in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It was written by a Publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by ſuch Authors as lived in the time when the things which they record, were tranſacted; the immediate Succeſſor to the Empire taking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways care, that the Hiſtory of his Predeceſſor ſhould be written.</p>
                     <p>Nay, to all this we muſt add, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi>'s way of writing, making no uſe of Letters, but of Hieroglyphicks, may have prevented theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which might otherwiſe have been made in their Hiſtory; the whole Life of a Man being hardly ſufficient, to attain to the perfect knowledge, of a Tongue which hath above Threeſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Figures which muſt be all learnt before a Man can be able only to Read and Write.</p>
                     <p>But, beſides that, all this depends upon the ſole Authority of <hi>Martinius,</hi> no body elſe beſide him having given us, as yet any opportunities of examining thoſe ancient Monuments of <hi>China;</hi> we may find out of this very Hiſtory ſome ſtrong Proofs, to confirm that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo eaſily reſolve the Difficulties which may be raiſed out of it, againſt the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>F. Martinius</hi> obſerves, that the common Opinion of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> is, that the World had a beginning: And tho' there be ſome of them of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Opinion, yet there was never any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that was for the Eternity of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46528:68"/>World, but ſince the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the Introduction of Idolatry amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He tells us, that they commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a God, whom they call <hi>Xangti,</hi> which is not the Name, but the Epithet of God, this word ſignifying Supream Governour of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He ſaith that they acknowledge a firſt Man brought forth out of the Chaos, in one Night in the Spring, which opinion ſome amongſt them have made intricate by the addition of their own Fables.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He ſhews that Sacrifices have been in uſe amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That they believe a certainty of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Rewards after this Life, for Vice and Vertue.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That they believe the exiſtence of good and bad Angels.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That they aſſign to ſome of them the protection of Cities and Provinces, and pay them great Veneration at the Inſtalment of their Magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, That they acknowledge them to be Incorporeal Beings, and that it is but of late, that they have Erected and Conſecrated Statues to them.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, That they have a very great knowledge of the Flood, which in their account happened about 3500 years before Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Here are, we ſee many truths which are the grounds of Religion, and which were known to them; from whence we may eaſily judge, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring thoſe Truths with the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:46528:69"/>that the ancient <hi>Chineſe</hi> did agree with all other Nations, in the believing the firſt Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, laid down by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may likewiſe obſerve, that thoſe Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>China,</hi> for the moſt part, are as like thoſe recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Tradition (which cannot but have received many alterations during ſuch a long interval of time) can be like to an exact Narrative of Matters of Fact drawn up by an Author who knew very well what he writ.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It appears that what they ſay, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Thirteen Succeſſors of the firſt man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Puoncuus,</hi> all deſcended from him, is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which ſets down the ſucceſſive Patriarchs from Father to Son. All the difference is, that the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> by a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ambition of appropriating all to themſelves, maintain that thoſe Thirteen Kings were all in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, What they tell us of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civiliz'd under the ſecond of thoſe Kings, call'd <hi>Thienhoang,</hi> after the death of the great Dragon that had diſturbed Heaven and Earth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees very well with the Hiſtory of <hi>Seth,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to form Mankind to a right notion of the worſhip of God, when he ſeparated them from <hi>Cain</hi>'s Family.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is very probable that when the <hi>Chineſe</hi> have reckoned up thirteen Kings lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcended from the firſt man, and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, they have included in that number <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> who tho' they were both the Sons of the firſt man, yet were not reckon'd up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe his Scope was only to give an Account of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46528:69"/>Deſcent of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity by <hi>Seth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They believe that under <hi>Ginhohang</hi> there was a kind of Golden Age, the Earth being then fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to admiration, and that under his Succeſſor Men being extreamly ſimple, and altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſeveral Arts neceſſary to Human Life, as of Characters and Letters, one <hi>Sujus,</hi> to ſupply the want of them, contrived a way of keeping up the memory of things, by tying ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of knots upon a Cord.</p>
                     <p>All which ſufficiently evinces, that the belief of the Worlds being lately created according to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deſcription, was as much received by the ancient People of <hi>China,</hi> as by all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>And here it is further obſervable, That the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeſe</hi> themſelves according to <hi>Martinius</hi>'s account, do ſuſpect all the Hiſtorical Records of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, before King <hi>Fobius,</hi> looking upon them as falſe and ridiculous; and indeed the People of that Country before <hi>Fobius,</hi> living like brute Beaſts, without any ſettled Government, Laws, or Arts: This alone is enough to confute thoſe amongſt the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who maintain now adays, that the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World before <hi>Confucius,</hi> who lived about 500 years before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was of no leſs than Three millions two hundred threeſcore and ſeven thouſand years. For hereby it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That they have fooliſhly affected to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in their vanity, who believing the Eternity of the World, pretended in order both to prove their Antiquity, and to give credit to their Aſtrological Obſervations, that Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy had been exercis'd amongſt them for 472000
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46528:70"/>years before <hi>Alexander</hi>'s entring into <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all, it is certain that their Calculation of 3000 years, from <hi>Fobius</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incompatible with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chronology, accord to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and not at all with that of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But moreover, what can be more palpably fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous than the whole Hiſtory of <hi>Fobius,</hi> whom the <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſuppoſe to have begun his Reign 2952 years before Jeſus Chriſt? Firſt, he is call'd the Son of Heaven, becauſe, they ſay, he had a Mother and no Father; and that his Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him by the Banks of a Lake near the Town of <hi>Lanthieu,</hi> where as ſhe was walking, ſhe ſaw the footſteps of a man upon the Sand, and was at the ſame time ſurrounded on a ſuddain with a Rainbow.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Situation of that Town which is in the Weſt of <hi>China,</hi> do's demonſtrate that the firſt Inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> came thither from the Weſtern parts of the World, and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were of <hi>Shem</hi>'s Poſterity, according to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s account in the Tenth of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Altho' there be perhaps no incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their aſcribing to him the Study of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and the invention of ſeveral Inſtitutions neceſſary to Human Society, as Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet what they add, that he was the firſt inventer of ſeveral Figures, which he had ſeen upon the back of a Dragon, ſufficiently ſhews, that either the whole ſtory is but a Fable, or that he was a Cheat, and impoſed upon the ſimplicity of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>What probability is there (ſeeing it is ſuppoſed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46528:70"/>
                        <hi>China,</hi> was then all over infeſted and overgrown with Barbariſm) that in his time it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in writing, 1. That he invented, inſtead of thoſe Knots before mentioned, the <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi> which are almoſt as obſcure. 2. That Men were then diſtinguiſhed from Women by the difference of their Garments. 3. That Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were then fixed and regulated which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were as promiſcuous amongſt Men as amongſt Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>What they ſay of his being the Author of a Muſical Inſtrument of 36 Cords, ſhews evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the falſhood of the Story; for there is nothing more improbable, than to ſuppoſe that he ſhould arrive to ſuch perfection of improvement in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick as that comes to, when that Art had but very lately been invented. It is all that men could attain unto, after they have long impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Art, the beginnings whereof, without doubt, as of all other Arts, were very rough and imperfect.</p>
                     <p>Surely the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were more reaſonable when they attributed the invention of the <hi>Lyre</hi> with three ſtrings to <hi>Mercury, Saturn</hi>'s Secretary, who is the ſame with <hi>Noah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>China</hi> takes notice that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Husbandry and Phyſick was under <hi>Fobius</hi>'s Succeſſor, it do's not mention whether he was his Son, or no; but it only gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the firſt War, wherein he was routed by a petty King, one of his Subjects, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the Empire.</p>
                     <p>And what is moſt ſingular in that Record, is, that therein is aſcribed to that Uſurper, 1. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46528:71"/>invention of the <hi>Cycle</hi> of 60 years, which ſerves to fix their Chronology. 2. The method of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Weights and Meaſures. 3. That it was by his means and encouragement that ſome of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Subjects found out the Sphere, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, Laws, Judicial Aſtrology, ſeveral Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruments, the Art of Dying, and of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Joyners and Carpenters Trade, ſo far as to make Boats and Bridges. They pretend that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dy'd, but that he was tranſlated alive into that place which the <hi>Chineſe</hi> do aſſign for Eternal Happineſs.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46528:72"/>high Mountains; but without any cauſe, for there was never ſeen a greater Serenity of Weather.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Martinius</hi> was certainly miſtaken, when he aſcribed to <hi>Chuenhious</hi> the regulating the <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> of the five leſſer Planets; ſeeing there are no ſuch <hi>Ephemerides</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> according to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations we have of that Countrey; nor yet any of the Sun and Moon ſo exact, as we have in <hi>Europe;</hi> a pregnant Demonſtration of which, is that the Miſſionary Jeſuits have been raiſed up to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the chiefeſt <hi>Mandarins</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their skill and learning in Aſtrology, was found to exceed that of any the moſt Learned Men amongſt the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> by many degrees.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things I thought fit to obſerve, to ſhew that there is nothing in the Hiſtory of <hi>China,</hi> which they ſo much cry up, that can any ways invalidiate the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Accounts in his Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> but what rather confirms it, if it be conſidered with attention.</p>
                     <p>It was not without reaſon, that I have ſuppoſed, that the memory of thoſe Ancient Tranſactions, was conveyed, tho' confuſedly, to the <hi>Chineſe;</hi> we have already intimated one of thoſe probable means of conveyance of this Tradition, by their Commerce which the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who were well informed of the greateſt part of thoſe ſeveral Tranſactions, and who had great intercourſe with the remoteſt Nations of <hi>Aſia,</hi> towards the Eaſt. To this we may add another Argument, yet more certain and ſure; which is the continual Commerce, that hath always been betwixt the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and the Communication which the Inhabitants of the Neighbouring Countries of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46528:73"/>the Red Sea, have always had with all the Eaſtern Nations of the World. For it is plain, that this Commerce gave a great opportunity of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to thoſe Eaſtern Nations, the knowledge of all thoſe Paſſages which were known to the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> Juſt as the like Commerce with the Weſtern Nations of the World, proved a means of conveying to them the knowledge of the moſt part of the ſame things, which in proceſs of time became the ground of the moſt Ancient Fables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> among whom thoſe Fables made up the beſt part of their Divinity.</p>
                     <p>But beſides all this, we may mention here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very likely means of conveyance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Commerce of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the <hi>Jews</hi> of the ten Tribes were diſperſed and ſetled, within a ſhort time after their Captivity in <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> For as thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> had with them the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo they eaſily gave a great inſight and knowledge in ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to thoſe Nations, that have appropriated it to themſelves, as may be made out, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Fabulous Hiſtory, with thoſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which contain in effect, all that relates to the Original of thoſe Nations.</p>
                     <p>But whatever judgment be made of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned means of conveying the Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> I think that I have good ground to affirm.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Hiſtorians that have written the Lives of the firſt Emperors of <hi>China,</hi> were not Contemporaries with thoſe Emperors, and that conſequently they have not recorded things ſo well known, as it was ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:46528:73"/>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Fables intermixt in their Hiſtories do ſufficiently evidence the eaſie and credulous temper of thoſe Authors, which takes away from them all credit and belief.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the greateſt care of thoſe Authors was to perſwade the World of the pretended Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their Nation, and ſo to raiſe the Honour and Reputation of it by glorious Stories and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That their affectation in giving us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Aſtronomy and Judiciary Aſtrology, was only to bring into Credit and Reputation thoſe Arts, the end and ſcope of which is to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Simple Men; which is a ridiculous Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch as hath expoſed the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> to the juſt Contempt and Deriſion of all other Nations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That there is amongſt them a Diverſity of Opinions contrary to one another, about their Antiquity; juſt as there were ſome amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who reckoned up 23000 years from the Reign of the Sun to <hi>Alexander;</hi> when ſome others reckoned b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a little above 10000 years.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Chineſe</hi> according to one of their own Opinions, muſt ſay, that the Earth was without almoſt any Inhabitants for 30000 years together, and above; whereas we ſee that in the ſpace of five or ſix thouſand years, it is become inhabited as we ſee it; and that within a little more, it will be ſo overſtockt, as that it will not be able to yield Proviſions enough for all its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as a Learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man hath of late proved it by a Mathematical Demonſtration;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46528:74"/>which ſhews, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> wanted certain grounds to go upon, in ſeveral Accounts which they give of many Tranſactions, and in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which, they are beſides moſt confident.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, That therefore, what is reported, that theſe <hi>Chineſe</hi> Authors did all write with publick allowance after every King's Deceaſe, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be ſo about the latter times, as it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but that it is as abſolutely falſe, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> had ever in former times, ſuch Publick Hiſtorians, and as it is falſe, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had formerly any ſuch, although they were as confident to ſay they had, in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s time, as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> are now.</p>
                     <p>But this, I think, is ſufficient for the clearing of that matter. We muſt now anſwer the laſt Objection of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> againſt the Authority of the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>

                     <p>AS I intend to clear all the Difficulties which may ariſe about this important Matter, in the Minds of thoſe that ſhall peruſe theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; I think my ſelf obliged to prevent and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46528:74"/>reſolve, the only plauſible Objection, I know remaining, after all what I have ſaid upon this Subject.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome will be apt to reply here that they indeed confeſs <hi>Moſes</hi> to be the Author of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and that, if that Book had really been Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, it could never have gone under his Name, nor be received as his, in after Ages. But that yet all this does not prove ſufficiently the truth of thoſe Tranſactions recorded in that Book. Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> may have forced upon the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the belief of them, by thoſe Laws that he enacted amongſt them, by which it was Death for any Man to dare to conteſt the truth of any thing he had written in his Books. This I think, is all, that the moſt Contentious <hi>Atheiſts</hi> can think of, to undermine the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>But this Objection is eaſily anſwered, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutes it ſelf. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It ſuppoſes the truth of theſe great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by which God eſtabliſh'd <hi>Moſes</hi> the Head and Captain of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which Miracles are every whit as hard to believe, as the ſeveral Accounts of other things which we read of, in the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find accordingly, amongſt the Heathens themſelves many Monuments of thoſe Miracles done by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> As I intend to ſhew in my Obſervations upon the other four Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, They muſt at leaſt ſuppoſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath given a true account of ſeveral Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in which he could not impoſe upon other
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46528:75"/>Nations, which did not acknowledge his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as for example, all that relates to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ark, the greateſt piece of Architecture that was then in the World; and to the raiſing of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> the greateſt Building that ever was, and part of which is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, for all theſe things were as ſo many Witneſſes of the truth of thoſe Tranſactions which he related.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They muſt likewiſe ſuppoſe, that he hath related ſeveral other Paſſages as exactly as he did thoſe, as for Example, That of the Diviſion of Tongues, which is an Appendix of the Hiſtory of the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> that of the Deſtruction of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the Original of the Neighbouring Nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> of the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites;</hi> for it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to conceive, that this Law-giver ſhould ever hope to perſwade other Nations to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Stories about Matters ſo well, and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, as thoſe were amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They muſt ſuppoſe further, that he hath given a true account of the Original of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whoſe Head and Governor he was. How great and abſolute ſoever the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> might be, it is ridiculous to imagine, that ever he would have derived the Original of the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> from any other, than from their true Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. This appears the more neceſſary in that we ſee by the accounts he gives of things, and Pedigrees in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that he wrote that Book eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> on to the end of it, only to ſhew the Rights, and juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46528:75"/>of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> upon the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They muſt yet further acknowledge, whither they will or not, the truth of the accounts he gives, concerning the Original of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Diviſions, which were kept up amongſt the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> now theſe Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having no other ground, than the Oracles which are related in his Hiſtory; they ſufficiently prove the Authority of thoſe Oracles againſt all the Pretenſions and Objections of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts.</p>
                     <p>What violence ſoever they may pretend that <hi>Moſes</hi> might uſe to force an Implicit Belief of his Hiſtory and blind Obedience to his Laws, yet no Man of common Senſe and Reaſon can ever think, that he would have fill'd the Accounts he gives of things of that nature, with Lies, or that if he had done it, he could ever have expected, that his falſe Accounts of them, ſhould ever have been credited by the Neighbouring Nations, or even by his own Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But without urging here ſeveral other Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which plainly ſhew, that there is no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be found, betwixt the Accounts of things which <hi>Moſes</hi> recites as publickly known, and thoſe which he relates of his own Head, and private knowledge; there being, as I have already ſhew'd, betwixt all thoſe ſeveral Accounts, ſuch a natural Coherence, and neceſſary Concatenation, that they cannot be divided from one another, without deſtroying the whole frame of his Hiſtory: I ſay, that it is impoſſible, that the Law, by which he makes it death, for any one to conteſt the truth of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46528:76"/>his Narration, ſhould make the ſincerity of it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                     <p>I do not urge here, that there is an evident Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated together all thoſe Tranſactions, as the grounds of Religion, if they had been abſolutely unknown in the World before him.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I mention here, that ſuppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had been ſo imprudent, as to attempt ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, yet there is no reaſon to believe, that a whole Nation, and that a very numerous one, would have long perſevered in a Profeſſion forced upon them by meer Violence and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I think it neceſſary to obſerve here, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were neither ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, nor ſo eaſily perſwaded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor yet ſo ſubmiſſive to him, as theſe Objectors do imagine.</p>
                     <p>That is plain, and apparent enough from all their Seditions and Conſpiracies againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I judge it neceſſary to obſerve here what is plain enough of it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no Succeſſor any ways concern'd, to countenance and defend theſe pretended Fictions and Fables of his Hiſtory, <hi>Joſhua</hi> his immediate Succeſſor was of another Tribe; and ſo were all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Governors of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the <hi>Maccabees</hi> came.</p>
                     <p>But what I think deſerves beſt to be obſerved here, is, that after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Deceaſe, the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was brought under the Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and conſequently freed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46528:76"/>from the Terror of that Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s making, by which it was Death for any one to conteſt the Authority of his Laws, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd the truth of all his Writings; there is but a little more than forty years interval betwixt the Conqueſt of <hi>Canaan</hi> by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the Bondage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations. Had it not been a fit time then, to caſt off the Yoak of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, and to publiſh the pretended Lies and Impoſtures of his Hiſtory? Was not the Compariſon which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could eaſily make betwixt the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Writings, and the Tradition generally received in the Countrey of their Captivity, a natural and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy means to undeceive them.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, we ſee that they obſtinately entertain the belief of the ſeveral Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſtand firmly to all their Pretenſions: Nay, we ſee them have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Remedy of Repentance which <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed them to uſe in thoſe ſad Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which he foretold ſhould befal them, and out of which he promis'd, at the ſame time, that God would miraculouſly deliver them; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was done accordingly, even fourteen times within leſs than four hundred years, as is manifeſt from the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Can there then be a more pregnant Argument, that if <hi>Moſes</hi> made it Death by one of his Sanctions, for any of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to conteſt the truth either of his Writings, or of his Oracles, and Miracles, it was not to force the belief of them without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but rather only to prevent the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that People, and their mingling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding themſelves with the Heathens, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46528:77"/>God intended to hinder on purpoſe, becauſe he would have the Meſſiah to be born according to his Promiſe, out of that Nation, which to effect, he thought fit in his infin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>The Conſequences of what we have proved in our foregoing Obſervations upon the Book of</hi> Geneſis.</head>
                     <p>THeſe ſeveral Obſervations which I have made upon the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are all, I think, very natural and eaſie; and if I am not miſtaken, ſufficient to prove ſolidly, the truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of the Creation of the World, and of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, which is the foundation of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Concluſion that I draw out of the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is, That,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I aſſert, that <hi>Moſes</hi> that famous <hi>Hebrew,</hi> who was deſign'd to be the Heir of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, is the true and ſole Author of the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I maintain, that this being once
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46528:77"/>granted, he could not, according to his way of Writing, record thoſe important Tranſactions, he relates otherwiſe than they really came to paſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I maintain, that tho he had not been an Eye. Witneſs of the Creation of the World, yet he hath made the Deſcription of it according to ſuch an Authentick Tradition, as cannot be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubted of, becauſe it was then the Univerſal Tradition, not only of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> of the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> and of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who were all of <hi>Sem</hi>'s Poſterity, and amongſt whom he had been travelling for forty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but alſo of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in a word, of all Men then living in the World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I maintain, that he never was found fault with, nor contradicted, till true Reaſon and Sence, if I may ſay ſo, was loſt and baniſh'd from amongſt Mankind, till the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for example, they who uſed before, to look upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> as meer Children and Ideots, were fallen into ſo great a Stupidity and Deprivation of Sence, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and maintain, that Men were firſt born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe forſooth, Frogs did naturally, as they thought, breed out of their Muddy Fenns and Marſhes.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I maintain, that for many Ages after <hi>Moſes.</hi> no body did ever publickly declare for the Eternity of the World, nor yet for its Fortuitous Production. Theſe Opinions are meer Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Chimeras, brought forth into the World by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> only about <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s time, or perhaps an hundred years before
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46528:78"/>him, <hi>i. e.</hi> about eleven or twelve hundred years after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, I maintain, that ſeeing there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time to be found, wherein the reading of the Law was interrupted and diſcontinued for any conſiderable time amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing it continues ſtill to this very hour amongſt them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath day, in the ſeveral places of the World, wherein they are diſperſed; and ſeeing beſides, that it is certain, that this Law, which enjoyns the Obſervation of the Sabbath, in remembrance of the Creation, could never be impoſed upon them, without their perceiving and declaring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Novelty and Suppoſition of that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and conſequently of the Book wherein it is related.</p>
                     <p>Seeing all this is certain, I do poſitively main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the truth of the Creation can never be better proved, than it is by the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> becauſe in it <hi>Moſes</hi> hath followed the Tradition of all the Ages that preceded him, and only recorded in Writing, what was then generally known of all Men in the World; and that in a time when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man was able to run his own Pedigree up to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I maintain, that as the certainty of the Creation cannot reaſonably be doubted of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rejecting at the ſame time all thoſe Proofs from Facts which I have brought to ſtrengthen my Aſſertion. So there is all the reaſon in the World to entertain the belief of it, as of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact which is indiſputable: As being Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the moſt Ancient Hiſtorian, Confirmed by the moſt Ancient Tradition, Believed by the

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHen I began at firſt theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> I deſign'd only to demonſtrate the certainty of the Creation of the firſt Man, and ſo to ſhew by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from matters of Fact, that neither the Creation of the World, nor yet the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, which God made to Man after his ſin, can reaſonably be diſputed or doubted of.</p>
                  <p>I deſign'd after that, to eſtabliſh the truth of Chriſt's Reſurrection, by ſuch another undeniable Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing, that the Apoſtles, were Eye Witneſſes of it, and inſtituted a ſolemn Day in every Week, to celebrate and perpetuate the Memory of it, amongſt Men, from their time down to the end of the World. And this I thought was ſufficient to demonſtrate the truth of the Chriſtian Religion: For as the <hi>Jews</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Celebration of the Sabbath, every Week, could eaſily run back to the Creation of the World, which was the occaſion of the Inſtitution of the Sabbath, ſo the Chriſtians may by the Weekly Obſervation of the Lord's day prove Chriſt's Reſurrection, which occaſioned the Inſtitution of
<pb facs="tcp:46528:81"/>the Lord's day. If we conſider the thing in it ſelf, there is no leſs Abſurdity to diſpute our Saviour's Reſurrection, than the Creation of the firſt Man.</p>
                  <p>Now if this Argument holds, as there can be no eaſier, ſo neither can there be a ſtronger proof of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion for provided we be once well aſſured of the certainty of Chriſt's Reſurrection, we muſt acknowledge him to be the true Meſſiah, and conſequently embrace his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems in the heat of Meditation, I was inſenſibly carried further, in my Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, than I thought at firſt to be. Therefore, inſtead of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing now, as I propoſed in the beginning, to the proof of Chriſt's Reſurrection, which is a ſolid and compendious way of demonſtrating the truth of his Religion, I find my ſelf engaged according to my preſent Method, to continue to make the like Reflexions upon the other Books of Holy Scripture, that I may yet more fully demonſtrate, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſiah, whom God promiſed to Man immediately after his ſin.</p>
                  <p>And this I intend to ſhew ſo plainly, as will make it evident, that God hath really accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his firſt deſigns, and exactly performed all his Promiſes relating to the Meſſiah, according to the firſt Idea's, he gave of his coming to the Ancient Patriarchs</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then I deſign to trace up the Method
<pb facs="tcp:46528:81"/>that God was pleaſed to uſe, to make the Meſſiah known without miſtake, when ever he ſhould come into the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will make ſome Reflexions upon the ſeveral Notions he gave of him long before in his Oracles, to Characterize his Perſon, his Offices, his Actions, his Sufferings, his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſt of all I will ſhew, that we have all this whole Project and Deſign exactly accompliſhed in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, as it was written by Chriſt's Diſciples. Now as this Method which God hath particularly choſen to make the Meſſiah known, appears alſo in the other Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> So I think it will not be amiſs for me particularly to view and examine theſe Books, that I may have occaſion to illuſtrate ſeveral things in them, which deſerve a particular attention, eſpecially when they are conſidered together, and as it were at one view.</p>
                  <p>For the Prophecies being thus conſider'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Connexion and Progreſs, do more plainly evidence God's Deſign, and may better convince or confound the <hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend accordingly to conſider thoſe Oracles with attention, and to join them together, that ſo they may in their Conjunction caſt forth the brighter Beams of Light, to the Conviction of all Infidels who may happen to peruſe this Book.</p>
                  <p>For I am perſwaded that, after the peruſal of my Obſervations in it, an ordinary attention in the
<pb facs="tcp:46528:82"/>reading of the Goſpel will be ſufficient to convince any Man, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true Meſſiah, which is all I intend to prove, as the Concluſion of this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now as the examination of the Patriarchs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion according to the account <hi>Moſes</hi> hath given us of it in his Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> hath taken up the firſt part of it; ſo I deſign to examine in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Religion, and to follow in my ſearch the account which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of it in his other four Books.</p>
                  <p>And as to effect this, it is very important to eſtabliſh beforehand the Authority of thoſe four Books: ſo I intend to ſhew firſt of all, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is the true Author of them, and that they have Intrinſick Characters of undeniable certainty.</p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, It will be natural for me, to ſhew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the writing of them, had the Promiſe of the Meſſiah in view, as particularly promiſed of God to the Patriarchs of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as being conſequently the principal, if not the ſole Object of their hope.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I intend to ſhew, that if we ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, we ſhall find in them ſuch a Method obſerved, as is both very agreeable to the manifeſtation of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s deſign in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and very worthy of his Wiſdom, eſpecially if we conſider what he was pleaſed to reveal unto us of his Intentions, by the Prophets who followed <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                        <hi>That it cannot reaſonably be doubted, but that</hi> Moſes <hi>is the Author of</hi> Exodus, <hi>and of the three other following Books.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is a Truth which may be grounded upon ſeveral ſolid Arguments.</p>
                     <p>I might obſerve, That <hi>Moſes</hi> hath always been acknowledged, by the very Heathens themſelves, not only to be the moſt Ancient Hiſtorian, but alſo the moſt Ancient Legiſlator in the World.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:46528:83"/>
                     <p>I might likewiſe obſerve, That there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular connexion betwixt the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and the other Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well in regard of the general Deſign of their Author, as of the Matters treated of in them. For Example, We ſee that the greateſt part of the Laws and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which we find written and recorded there, derive their Original from thoſe Tranſactions and Paſſages that we read of in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Thus we may plainly diſcern that the pretenſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was grounded upon the Promiſe that God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> to give it to his Poſterity, in the fourth Generation. Thus we may ſee, That the <hi>Amalekites</hi> could have no other reaſon to make War againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> than the old Alliance that was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made betwixt <hi>Amalek</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> which without doubt engaged his Poſterity to be the firſt Oppoſers of the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus we ſee that the Seditions of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> under <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> did proceed from the Order of the Birth of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is ſet down in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> becauſe the eldeſt thinking themſelves wrong'd of their Birthright, thought they might juſtly Rebel againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in order to recover it.</p>
                     <p>But I haſte to things more material than theſe. And firſt it is here obſervable, That thoſe Books were not only religiouſly kept in every Family of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but that they were alſo once ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the Tabernacle as a publick Record, and that by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf a little before his death, that they might be a Teſtimony againſt that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46528:83"/>People, as we read it <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> XXXI. 26.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It cannot be denied that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſtraightly charge both <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and the Heads of the People, to read them frequently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for it is expreſly ſaid ſo, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.8. Nay, we ſee about 500 years after, the holy Man <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who had made, during his life,
<note place="margin">Pſal. I.</note> the ſupream felicity of a man to conſiſt in the reading the Law of God day and night: We ſee, I ſay, that holy Man give in his Death-bed the ſame Charge to <hi>Solomon,</hi> I <hi>Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Moreover it is certain that there were many Laws and Sanctions contained in thoſe Books, which are the Foundation of the Hiſtory of ſucceeding Times. And this is the reaſon why we read nothing in the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Bleſſings and Curſes which were to be pronounced upon the Mounts <hi>Ebal</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim,</hi> becauſe the form of them was to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> which were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Authentick. The ſame Reflexion may be made upon the Law of the Firſt-fruits, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prayer which was to be made upon the Tithes of the third year; as likewiſe upon many other Laws.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is certain that thoſe Books were read over every ſeventh Year, according to the Injunction of that Law, which we find <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> XXXI. 10, 11. which was commanded to be done for the inſtruction of Poſterity, as it is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the Thirteenth <hi>Verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Whereupon it may not be prepoſterous to conſider here God's Methods, to prevent all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and Impoſture in this Matter.</p>

                     <p>We ſee that it was, during the Longaevity of Human Life, a conſtant and univerſal Cuſtom amongſt all the Patriarch's to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, to put (when they lay on their Death beds) their Poſterity in mind of the moſt important Truths, and of the Fundamental Articles of Religion, becauſe as all Admonitions and Exhortations made at ſuch a time, are always look'd upon as ſincere, ſo they ſeldom fail of being favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſtrued and better entertained, than they would be at any other time. We have as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ancient Cuſtom, the Examples of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>Joſeph, &amp;c.</hi> who in that, I make no doubt, follow'd the Cuſtom of their pious Anceſtors, who in all likelyhood derived it from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. That Cuſtom we ſee was of an admirable uſe to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the memory of illuſtrious Tranſactions: What was then ſpoken by thoſe pious venerable men, was a kind of a publick Sermon, becauſe it was delivered before thoſe numerous Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which met then altogether about the Bed of their common Head and Father; and that upon ſuch an Occaſion as did extraordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite their attention.</p>
                     <p>To this Cuſtom ſucceeded another, which was, that when the greateſt Captains and Judges of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſenſible of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, then they uſually called the People together, to give them ſuch Exhortations, Reproofs, and Admonitions, as they judged moſt proper, either for their encouragement, or for their Reformation; nay, and that even in ſome occaſions many of them have affected to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46528:84"/>have their Speeches made publick, and depoſited in the Tabernacle: Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and the greateſt number of the Judges, and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We know that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read every Sabbath day; as St. <hi>James</hi> does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it in <hi>Acts</hi> XV. And tho there be no expreſs command about it in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings, yet we find there, ſomething equivalent to it, in the ſtrict charge given by him to all the People, to be continually converſant in his Books, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Families at all times in the Laws and Doctrines delivered in them; for it is plain, that if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bound by that command of <hi>Moſes</hi> to read his Books every day, they were more particularly obliged, by the ſame command, to read them on the Sabbath day, which was made a day of reſt by God; particularly on purpoſe, that all Men might the better attend on that day to the reading and meditating God's Laws, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all other Religious Duties.</p>
                     <p>We know beſides that thoſe Books were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually explained both by the Doctors of the Law, and the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were on purpoſe diſperſed through the whole Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might the better attend and perform the Duties of their Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Writings hath exactly kept a kind of Journal, which cannot eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any alteration. If we read hereupon what relates to the ſojourning of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the ſeveral removals of their Tents in the Deſert, we ſhall be eaſily convinc'd by the very form and ſtile of thoſe Books, as we have them now, that they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46528:85"/>were formerly publickly received, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tranſcribed out of the Original, and that if in Proceſs of time they ſuffered any alteration, it was only as to ſome Appendices or Poſtſcripts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by <hi>Eſrah,</hi> or ſome other Prophet, by way of Explication.</p>
                     <p>We ſee in thoſe Books a Hiſtory written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguiſe or partiality, exact in relating all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of Places, Times, and Perſons, even in the Narration of things of ſmall importance for the main drift of the Author; there are beſides, ſome Paſſages recorded in them, which any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who lived after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have left out, if for no other reaſon, yet at leaſt to aboliſh the memory of ſome actions diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſome great Families, and whole Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, we read in them the Songs, and other Publick Monuments which were made upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions, to preſerve the memory of them the better.</p>
                     <p>I have but three Obſervations more to make here, and then I have done with this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That thoſe Books have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly quoted by all the Authors amongſt that People who followed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that their Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations do exactly agree with the Text of thoſe Books, as we have them now, which is a certain ſign, as well of the Sincerity, as of the Antiquity of that Author. They were as much eſteemed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as in <hi>Juda,</hi> both People did obſerve them as their Law: The Prophets that aroſe from time to time, did always, and upon all Occaſions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46528:85"/>and maintain their Authority.</p>
                     <p>Thus we find in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> quoted out of them, what relates to the Curſes and Bleſſings, to the Prophecies, and Diviſions of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> amongſt the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The whole Hiſtory of the thirteen Judges, whom God raiſed up amongſt the People, is nothing in general, but an account of the accompliſhment of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which God had made formerly by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to raiſe up from among that People ſuch Men in the time of their Afflictions and Captivities, as would be the Aſſertors of their Liberty.</p>
                     <p>We ſee there in particular, the Execution of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s order, concerning <hi>Caleb,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg I. 20. Judg. VII. 3. Judg. XIII. 3.</note> and of that Law in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which preſcribes the manner of diſmiſſing from the Army thoſe that are fearful and faint-hearted; and of that other concerning the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that the Rule and Laws preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in thoſe Books, continued in force in the time of <hi>Ruth, David</hi>'s Great Grand-Mother, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly, by their Obſervation of thoſe Laws, which enjoyn'd the next Kinſman to take to Wife the Widow of his Deceaſed Relation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Inheritance. As for <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> they are continually alluding to ſomething or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delivered in thoſe Books: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> quotes them in Chap. XIII. of his Book, and that was in the year of the World 3563, and ſo does <hi>Malachy</hi> in the IV. and V. Chapters of his Propheſie, in the year 3580.</p>
                     <p>The Second Obſervation, which is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, is, that the Author of thoſe Books, hath inſerted in them an expreſs prohibition of adding any
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46528:86"/>thing to them, as we ſee it <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> IV. 2.</p>
                     <p>It is then impoſſible, ſeeing that the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> have always acknowledged the Divine Authority of thoſe Books, that they ſhould ever have attempted the alteration of any thing in them.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we ſee, not without wonder, that after the greateſt part of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were tranſported into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> thoſe that were ſent from <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to inhabit their Countrey, did receive that Law, and that their Poſterity have kept it all along to this day, as uncorrupted as the <hi>Jews,</hi> altho' they continue their Mortal Enemies, and have been expoſed to all the Changes, and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that can befal a Nation, during the long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of 2400 years.</p>
                     <p>The Third Obſervation, which deſerves a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Attention is, That notwithſtanding the great and many Corruptions, which the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into, yet theſe Books have ſtill been kept up in the ſame form that we have them now: It appears out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> related, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XXIII. 21. That after the Book of the Law, of <hi>Moſes</hi> own writing, was found in the Temple, the King commanded all the People to keep the Paſſover unto the Lord, <hi>as it is written in the Book of this Covenant:</hi> Now we have the Inſtitution of the Paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> XII. which ſhews, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> by the Book of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, meant the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſuch as we have them now adays, and ſuch as they were when <hi>Moſes</hi> depoſited them into the Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>It is important to conſider well, all that is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the forementioned Chapter of II <hi>Kings,</hi> for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46528:86"/>we may gather out of it, that it was according to the Directions of this Law, that they began to reform all the Superſtitions and Idolatries which had been introduced in their Religion, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the Royal Authority, from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time to <hi>Joſiah;</hi> this Chapter relates and commends the proceeding of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> only in oppoſition to the ill government of his Predeceſſors, and to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Monuments of their Superſtitions, which he aboliſhed in obedience to God's Laws, contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, it is certain, that it was no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to impoſe herein upon Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, The Tranſactions recorded in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not only relate to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo to moſt of the Neighbouring Nations.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Memory of them continued ſo lively and univerſal, that almoſt 1500 years after <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Names of thoſe Magicians ſpoken of, <hi>Exod.</hi> VII. 11. were, as yet known, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we ſee it by an expreſs Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaks of them,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hiſt. Nat.</hi> l. 30. c. 1.</note> and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their Names, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 8. but alſo among the Heathens, as both <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Numenius</hi> do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it.</p>
                     <p>I point only at thoſe general Proofs at preſent, becauſe I have already made uſe of them, and ſhew'd their force in my Obſervations upon <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and becauſe I intend to repeat, and improve ſome of them hereafter in this Treatiſe. But now, in order to follow my preſent deſign, I muſt come to the more particular Conſideration of the things contained in theſe Books, which will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46528:87"/>much conduce to the Confirmation of the ſame Truth.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. II. </head>
                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>That both the Character of</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Perſon, and the nature of the things he relates has always made men read his Books with attention.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>The Subject of ſome Books is ſuch, as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone would recommend them to the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Reader, tho' their Author had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the World; but when beſides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of their Subject, the Author of them is famous and of great repute, then to be ſure, they never fail to be read with ſerious attention, and preſerved with as great a care. The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> have both theſe advantages, ſo that they cannot reaſonably be ſuſpected of the leaſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Forgery.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Character that we diſcover in theſe Books at the firſt viewing of them, is the great ſingularity, and admirable diverſity of their Stile, and of the Matters they treat of.</p>
                     <p>We do not ſee that other Legiſlators did ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to act the parts of Hiſtorians; no, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with their abſolute power, to make Laws, without giving any reaſon for the Sanction of them: Therefore we ſee, that there is commonly nothing more dry and ſapleſs than all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46528:87"/>about both Civil, and Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Moſes</hi> we ſee hath followed a more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and more ſatisfactory method, all his Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are grounded upon the great Tranſactions which he relates; he enacts no Law of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, but he intimates to the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the ſame time, the Reaſons which challenge their Obedience, and makes them by that means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect both upon the ſeveral Mercies of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, and call to mind the great Miracles they had been eye witneſſes of.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs indeed, that the uſe and ſcope of ſome of his Regulations, is very abſtruſe, eſpecially now, that we are ignorant of the ſeveral Heathen Cuſtoms, which God deſign'd to aboliſh from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that People newly come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where during their Captivity they had complied, and accuſtomed themſelves in a great meaſure to the Rites, and Religion of their Maſters the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> But yet how abſtruſe ſoever the deſign of ſome of thoſe Laws may now appear to be: We have good ground to affirm, that the general ſcope of them all was, to keep that People from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in diſtinguiſhing them from all other Nations, as alſo to quicken their Deſires and Expectations of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Promiſe of whoſe coming had been made by God in the very beginning of the World, and renewed ſeveral times to the Heads of their Nation.</p>
                     <p>However we ſee in the Books of thoſe Laws, Religion, and Policy ſo interwoven together, that the latter ſeems to ſubſiſt only by the ſupport and aſſiſtance of the former, which is contrary to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46528:88"/>cuſtom of human Legiſlators, who do not ſo much regard the eſtabliſhment of Religion, as the preſervation and welfare of the State and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> had a mind to be informed about the Tradition of his Anceſtors, and the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of old, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath preſerved it with ſuch care, with ſo many marks of Fidelity, and ſo clear and plain, that there is no other Hiſtory beſides his, that can give any ſatisfactory Information about the Original of things: All the Fables of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, which yet make up the moſt ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they have, being nothing elſe but a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and depravation of the ſeveral Truths that <hi>Moſes</hi> relates in his Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> deſired to ſee the beginnings of that Common wealth of which he was a Member; <hi>Moſes</hi> gives an accurate account of them.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> deſired to know the Original of Mankind, or what was the true happineſs of Man, and what he ought to do, in order to be a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that happineſs, <hi>Moſes</hi> teaches all that with great evidence and exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> had a mind to know the occaſion of thoſe Songs that were ſo much in faſhion amongſt thoſe of his Nation; he might eaſily ſatisfie his Curioſity, by reading <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> deſired to know what ſort of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations they were, which the Founder, both of their Religion and Common-wealth, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made to their Fore-fathers; <hi>Moſes</hi> relates a great many of them in his Books.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> had a mind to receive inſtruction about the Original, and cauſe of thoſe Temporal
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46528:88"/>Bleſſings, he enjoyed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which God had poſſeſs'd his Nation of, after the Expulſion of thoſe People that had been the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of it for many Ages, <hi>Moſes</hi> gives as good account of all that, as can be deſired.</p>
                     <p>If any <hi>Jew</hi> had a mind to know the Original of the ſeveral Calamities that befel his Nation on ſeveral occaſions; <hi>Moſes</hi> acquainted them both with the Cauſe and Remedy of all their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If the <hi>Jews</hi> deſired to be informed of the future condition of their Common-wealth in after Ages; <hi>Moſes</hi> foretells it in ſo particular and clear a manner, that they might look upon his Propheſies, not as certain Propheſies only, but as a plain Hiſtory of future Events, begun and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out, before their Accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>All this is ſo much the more conſiderable, to oblige us to read the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> with care, that we may juſtly obſerve three things in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which as they raiſe him above all common Authors, ſo they cannot but ſtrengthen the belief, and increaſe the Eſteem and Veneration, which we ought to have for his Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That whereas all Men are careful to conceal their own Infirmities, and whatever is diſhonourable to their Familles: <hi>Moſes</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſeems to have affected to record all the things that could blemiſh the memory of his Anceſtors, and derogate to his own Reputation. He blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes <hi>Jacob</hi>'s memory by his relating, how he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Son of his Beloved Wife, to <hi>Reuben</hi> his Eldeſt, whom he unjuſtly deprived of his Birthright, in favour of the other, which inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46528:89"/>is expreſly forbidden by one of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws.</p>
                     <p>Thus he lays an eternal blot and reproach upon the memory of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Head of his own Family, when he mentions his Cruelty and Violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> and the diſperſion of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity amongſt the other Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, what is more, he vilifies his own Birth, by forbidding any Marriage betwixt an Aunt and her Nephew, ſeeing he relates that he himſelf was born of <hi>Jocabed</hi> both Aunt and Wife to his Father <hi>Amram;</hi> he deſcribes his own Incredulity with all the Ingenuity imaginable, when he repreſents the ſeveral Miracles which God wrought by him, he ſeems to ſpeak of himſelf only to lay open his own failings and ſins; ſuch a ſincerity and Impartiality we know confirms and increaſes mightily the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any Author.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> not regarding the advantage and honour of his own Family, left the Government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> one of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and ſo reduced his own Children, and their Poſterity to the low condition of the reſt of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Rank to that of Prieſts; for we do not ſee that they ever after renew'd the pretenſions which they might otherwiſe have had to ſucceed <hi>Moſes;</hi> now ſuch neglect of his Family ſhews, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Principles were raiſed much above the ordinary pitch of the generality of Law givers, who were abſolute and ſupream over their People.</p>
                     <p>The Third thing obſervable here is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no ſhare in the Conqueſt of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> it all was ſubdued after his Death: Nay, it was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46528:89"/>that Conqueſt, that fixed, and ſetled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was before unſetled, and as it were ambulatory in the Deſart. Now how could ſuch a ſingular deſign, as <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in his Law, be put in execution by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by him that formed it. It was <hi>Joſhua</hi> that made this Conqueſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and poſſeſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of it; now, to be ſure if that People had not been then fully perſwaded of the Divine Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have failed after ſo great an alteration to make uſe of their Power and Liberty in throwing off the troubleſom yoak of his Laws; nor yet would <hi>Joſhua</hi> and all his Succeſſors in the Government, ever have maintain'd the Authority of thoſe Laws, if they had not lookt upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> not only as an extraordinary Man, but alſo as one particularly Commiſſionated by God to make that Body of Laws, for the regulating of his People.</p>
                     <p>We read in thoſe Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s dying in the Mountains of <hi>Moab;</hi> now that being ſuppoſed, how is it poſſible, that if the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not been fully convinced that God himſelf gave their Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> with all the Circumſtances mentioned by him, they would have continued to keep up ſuch a ridiculous and ill grounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. If he had really by his Tyrannical Authority forced the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into a compliance to his Laws during his Life, why did they not aſſoon as he was dead, with the fear of his Authority ſhake off the yoak of his Laws, and all reſpect for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>One thing we may remark as very ſurprizing in the Relation of that Legiſlator's Death; which is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46528:90"/>that his Body was not found after his Death.</p>
                     <p>For we do not ſee that that People, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe kept up and carried about with ſo much care, the Bones of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Bury, and Depoſite them in the Sepulchres of their Anceſtors (for both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were interred in <hi>Judaea</hi>) did ever build a Tomb to their Law-giver, or ſo much as pretend to ſhew his Sepulchre.</p>

                        <hi>Joſephus</hi> was of Opinion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the account of his own Death, for fear the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould ever imagine, and ſo give out that God had taken him up into Heaven. I ſee, I confeſs, no ſolidity in that Conjecture of his, but yet it may give us occaſion to make a Reflection hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think, more natural and eaſie, which is, that God had a mind, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> intimates it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the many Characters of Divinity that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by taking away from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the <hi>Jews</hi> his Corps, which they would certainly, if they had not been ſo prevented, have kept with more care than thoſe of all their Patriarchs and Kings. The Deſcription of the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Death, ſhews evidently, that he was not only in great eſteem during his Life, but that even his Death did much conduce to the increaſe of it, and to make Men look upon him, as one gloriouſly raiſed up above the common condition of Men, and in a manner not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Infirmities and Miſeries incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. But after theſe general Reflexions, I muſt come to thoſe that are more particular.</p>

                     <p>As Firſt of all, the Miraculous Birth, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Education, the Heroical Courage, and the Divine Call and Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſeveral Miracles which he wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of it, and lead them to the Borders of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then Secondly, All the Moral, Ceremonial, and Political Laws which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from God.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prophecies concerning their future Condition, their Victories, their Captivities, their Tranſportations, concerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the diſperſion of their whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>All which Paſſages have as evident and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick proofs of their certainty, as things of that nature are capable of.</p>
                     <p>Let us firſt begin with the Narration of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles recorded in the beginning of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein we ſee, that after <hi>Moſes</hi> had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and of all the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46528:91"/>that came down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he writes his own Hiſtory, and repreſents himſelf as another <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaved out of the Waters, to ſave and deliver that Holy Family.</p>
                     <p>The whole Relation which he makes of all thoſe particulars, is very ſtrange, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but yet his Circumciſion, and the inſtruction of his Mother, to whom he was given, by the Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be nurſt up, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of that Princeſs who had adopted him, and made her ſelf a Proſelyte as the <hi>Jews</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove,

                        </note> from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> IV. 18. And his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in the Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all the Grandees of that Court, did concur together to acquaint him with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable preſervation of his perſon, and perſwade him of the certainty of it.</p>
                     <p>For how could either <hi>Moſes</hi> impoſe, or be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in that matter? Was not that Barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by which they compell'd the <hi>Jews</hi> about the time of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Birth, to throw their Children into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> notoriouſly known of all Men? Were not the Publick Buildings, and ſtrong Cities, <hi>viz.

And was it not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known by all the World, that the poor <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were the Slaves and Drudges who were made uſe of to erect thoſe Buildings.</p>
                     <p>Neither could the manner of his Education be unknown to him, nor yet to any of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> for we do not join here to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Narration, what <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates of his Perſon, of his Feats in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> and of his Marrying an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Princeſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles were done in the preſence of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo they teſtifie, that he had really received his Calling, and Commiſſion from God in the Deſert, and that juſt in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he deſcribes it himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now, no Man can diſpute the truth of thoſe Miracles, if he but minds the following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It cannot be denied, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Their Law, which the preſent <hi>Jews</hi> do ſtill obſerve, ſpeaks every where of that famous Action of his; there was never any Man diſputed the certainty of that Atchievement. All ancient Authors make mention of it,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joſeph. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra App.</hi> l. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Manethon</hi> gives an account of the time, of the manner, and of many other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Circumſtances of that Exploit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trogus Pompeius, Juſtinus,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> do alſo ſpeak of it, only <hi>Tacitus</hi> does groundleſly, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of his own head, relate, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were expell'd out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie: I ſay groundleſly, for it is known, that on the contrary, Leproſie was a common Diſtemper amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and that they infected the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with it, ſo that there is no likelihood they ſhould be expelled by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that they got from them.</p>
                     <p>We know beſides, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which calls the Leproſie the Diſtemper of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Lepers out of the Congregation of the People; and then the nature of <hi>David</hi>'s Curſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Joab,</hi> becauſe of his murdering <hi>Abner,</hi> ſhews ſufficiently, that the Leproſie was lookt upon by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a Diſtemper moſt commonly ſent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46528:92"/>immediately from God. Nay, <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> himſelf,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Juſtin.</hi> l. 36.</note> obſerves that the Magicians cauſed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be expell'd, becauſe they themſelves were ſtruck with a kind of Scab and Itch; and that they were afraid, leaſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of it ſhould infect the whole Kingdom of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And here I muſt not forget the mentioning the Teſtimony of <hi>Numenius</hi> a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſopher, who relates, that both <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> were choſen by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to oppoſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> and hinder the effects of his Miracles and Prayers, which had brought down many grievous Plagues upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> juſt about the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment out of that Country.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, If the Leproſie, which the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> brought from <hi>Egypt,</hi> be a indiſputable proof of their ſojourning there; it is as certain, that the going out of that mixed multitude of <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who ſo far eſpous'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Intereſt, as to leave and forſake <hi>Egypt</hi> their own Countrey to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, could have no other cauſe or pretence than the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereof they had been Eye-witneſſes; ſo that the Poſterity of thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> that were thus incorporated into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were in after Ages, as ſo many Witneſſes of the truth of thoſe Miracles, which formerly perſwaded their Fathers to joyn with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo to ſhare Fortune with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is certain, that the <hi>Jews</hi> could not ſo much as mention any of the Miracles, which they pretended were done formerly for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Fathers, without expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46528:92"/>to the ſcorn of all the World, if all thoſe Miracles, and their Deliverance, had not been certainly and generally known to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to all the Neighbouring Nations, by whom they were often ſubdued and brought into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction after the Deceaſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To all theſe Reflexions we may add, that the Commemoration of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was renew'd yearly, not only by the ſolemnizing the Feaſt of the Paſſover, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did conſtantly keep to the time of their diſperſion, and which they do ſtill keep in all parts of the World, but alſo by two other very ſenſible ways.</p>
                     <p>The firſt whereof, was the Separation which God made of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> in order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it to his Service, inſtead of the firſt-born of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he had ſpared, and preſerved in <hi>Egypt,</hi> with great Solemnity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of Men and Beaſts, as we read, <hi>Numb.</hi> III. ſo that every <hi>Levite</hi> was as a living Memorial of that great Miracle, wrought at the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going forth out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Second was the Law concerning the Redemption of every Firſt-born, both of Men,
<note place="margin">Numb. XVIII: 16.</note> and Unclean Beaſts; which is obſerved to this hour amongſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> It is clear, and evident, that there is in all thoſe Laws, a deep impreſſion of thoſe ſeveral great Miracles which compell'd <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is very obſervable here, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wrought, as by many Miracles, ſo eſpecially by the death of all the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46528:93"/>was the occaſion of the Inſtitution of the Paſſover continued amongſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> till after Jeſus Chriſt: For till then they uſed to mark with red their Sheep, their Trees, their Houſes, and Lands, the day before the Paſſover, as one may ſee in <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> which Cuſtom could proceed from no other cauſe, than from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fear of the like Plague and Mortality, that was once inflicted upon their Forefathers; and from their hope of preventing it by ſuch a kind of Taliſman, whereby they thought <hi>Moſes</hi> had formerly ſaved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> harmleſs from that great Plague, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſprinkling the Blood of the Lamb of the Paſſover, on the upper Door poſt of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <p>THeſe Arguments might be thought ſufficient for the evincing the truth of theſe Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates; but yet ſomething more may be added.</p>
                     <p>As thoſe Stupendious Miracles, by which the famous deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was effected, could not be doubted of, by thoſe who had been eye-witneſſes of them; ſo they were afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſeveral other Miracles, which being as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46528:93"/>great, and almoſt of the ſame kind, continued for many years in the ſight of the whole People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God made a Pillar of Fire, and of a Cloud, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to guide them, the one by Day, and the other by Night. He divided the Red Sea to open a paſſage through it for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">L. 9. <hi>praep. Ev. cap. ult.</hi>
                        </note> the Memory whereof (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi>) was preſerved to his time, by thoſe of <hi>Memphis:</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took the Spoils of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drown'd in the Red Sea, as they were purſuing them: They made a Song upon the occaſion of that wonderful Deliverance; they were fed with <hi>Manna,</hi> a kind of heavenly, and miraculous Food; they drunk of that Brook of Water, that was following them wherever they went: All thoſe Miracles, with many others, continued for forty years together without any Interruption, and do therefore firmly eſtabliſh the truth of thoſe other Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, becauſe there were none of them wherein the people could be impoſed upon by any trick or illuſion, and of the truth whereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one could not ſatisfie himſelf, by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſpeak now of ſeveral publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe Miracles; as for Example, the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> which bloſſom'd in a Night; the Manna which was kept in the Tabernacle. The Brazen Serpent, which having continued to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, was broken down by him, only becauſe the People offered Incenſe to it.</p>
                     <p>From all which it muſt be acknowledged, that there was in the whole Series of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory both many pregnant Evidences of the truth of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46528:94"/>the firſt Miracles, and a conſtant Series of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which having been foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> did the better confirm the truth of thoſe which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates as done by him on purpoſe to vindicate, and defend the Liberty, and Honour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Becauſe I did juſt now intimate, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Deliverance, did continue for many Ages after amongſt the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> I think my ſelf obliged to add here, ſome Arguments to prove, that neither ſuch a Tranſaction as that was, nor yet any of the like nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, could ever be forgotten in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing that in outward appearance ſeems more ridiculous, than what is related con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> coming to <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s Camp; their Equipage ſhew'd that they had a mind to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that they came from a far Countrey. The Treaty which they extorted from <hi>Joſhuah</hi> by fraud, is very ſingular.</p>
                     <p>And there can be nothing more remarkable, than their ſubſiſtence amongſt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> notwithſtanding that they were of the number of thoſe Nations, which God had commanded to be deſtroy'd; and their being deſtined by <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s appointment, to carry the Wood and the Water, neceſſary for the ſervice of the Tabernacle, from whence they were denominated <hi>Nethinims,</hi> and thereby for ever after diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But after all, there could be nothing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to God's Wiſdom, than the preſervation of that people amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46528:94"/>were the Witneſſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s Miracles. Thoſe Miracles obliged them to ſeek the alliance of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to cheat them into it by a fraudulent Treaty, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of compaſſing their deſign by any other means. Therefore their ſubſiſting amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Servile Office which expoſed them to the eyes of the whole Nation, could not chuſe but be of an extraordinary uſe, to make that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſerve, and cheriſh up the Memory of thoſe Glorious Actions, which every <hi>Gibeonite</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually before his Eyes.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Remark may be made upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of <hi>Rahab</hi>'s Family amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Deſtruction of <hi>Jericho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is certain, that the <hi>Jews</hi> have always belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that beſides thoſe firſt Miracles related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> many others have been done ſince for their ſakes, both to poſſeſs them of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to keep or reſtore them to the poſſeſſion of it; nay, of thoſe latter Miracles many are very like unto the former: As for Example, the Death of 185000 Men in the Army of <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> the returning of the Shadow backwards ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon the Sundial of <hi>Ahaz;</hi> the wonderful preſervation of the whole Nation, by the means of <hi>Eſther,</hi> which was the occaſion of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> amongſt them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Miraculous Tranſactions related in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors, of which I will only name three, which did preſerve the Memory of the greateſt, and moſt important Miracles related by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is the continual Miracle of the <hi>Urim</hi>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:46528:95"/>and <hi>Thummim</hi> of the High-Prieſt, which by its frequency, did confirm the truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the ſeveral Apparitions of God, in order to lead his people, and to give them Laws.</p>
                     <p>The Second is the Miracle of every ſeventh year,
<note place="margin">Levit. XXV.</note> during which, though the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did neither Sow nor Reap, God, according to his Promiſe, did ſupply them with plenty of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by making every ſixth year extraordinarily plentiful. Now this Miracle was a kind of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of that other great Miracle, whereby God did feed his People with Manna, for forty years together in the Deſart, ſtill doubling the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manna every ſixth day.</p>
                     <p>In effect, as that Law which commanded a Sabbath of reſt unto the Land every ſeventh year, was conſtantly obſerved, which would never have been done long, if that people had not always been fully convinced by their own experience of its Divinity.</p>
                     <p>And again, as that Miracle was ſo publickly known, that God by his Prophets did often threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>Jews</hi> to deprive them of the fertility of the ſixth year, becauſe of their tranſgreſſing the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>So it is plain, that no Man can reaſonably doubt, or diſpute the truth of that continual Miracle, which that Law both ſuppoſeth and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>The Third is the Miracle of a continual prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction during the time of thoſe three great ſolemn Feaſts, in which the people were obliged by God's Command to attend his Service in the Tabernacle,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46528:95"/>or at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For this Law requiring atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from all the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Age of Twenty and upwards, it engaged them to leave the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of their Countrey naked, and deſtitute of Men, and ſo expoſed to the Inroads of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but at the ſame time it gave them occaſion to experience the ſame Divine Protection, which, as they read in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings, their Fathers had formerly ſo often experienced againſt all their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that there was never any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in the World, which had any ſuch Fundamental Law; the danger to which a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is expoſed by the Obſervation of it is too viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not to be avoided. Therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſure, would never have acknowledged that Law to be Divine, nor yet ſubmitted to it, if they had not been ſecure of God's Protection to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all the Miſchiefs, and Inconveniences that might ariſe from their Obſervation of that Law; ſo that ſuppoſe they had been at firſt ſo ſtupid and unwary as to receive it from <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they would never have obſerved it ſo conſtantly and ſo long, if they had not had a conſtant Trial of God's Protection on all occaſions; and if they had not lookt upon it as a neceſſary Conſequence, and Accompliſhment of thoſe Promiſes, which he had made both to them and their Fathers.</p>
                     <p>However, it is certain, that it was the Will of God, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould altogether rely upon that Miraculous Protection of his: Nay, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting of it, was ſo offenſive to him, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted an Exemplary Puniſhment upon <hi>David,</hi> for an Action, which though innocent of it ſelf in a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46528:96"/>Prince, did yet directly contradict that Truſt which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bound to ſet upon God's Protection. For when <hi>David</hi> cauſed the People to be numbred, God ſent a Peſtilence amongſt his people, which abated his pride, and thus taught him effectually to rely more upon God for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than upon the Multitude of his people.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall not ſtand to conſider here the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Equity, and moſt abſolute perfection of the Moral Law, and ſhew that it could have no other Author but God alone: Neither will I urge in this place, the extraordinary care God had to regulate the moſt Minute Ceremonies, that there might be nothing left undetermined in all the Acts of Religion; as alſo the great, and Divine Wiſdom that is diſcernible in all thoſe Ceremonial Laws, which beſides their uſeful oppoſition, to the then <hi>Pagan</hi> Cuſtoms, do moſt of them, either mind Men of their Duty, or repreſent and typiſie the things that were to come to paſs under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:46528:96"/>
                     <p>In ſhort, I will not aggravate any farther the Conſideration of the Admirable Wiſdom that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears every where in the whole Body of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Laws which God gave to the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſettle them into a firm and ſolid Form of Government; that Wiſdom is ſuch, and ſo viſible, that it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrates the Divinity of them to any Man that will but compare the whole Body of them, and their abſolute perfection, with the Defects of all Human Laws, and the ſeveral Changes and Alterations they have received from time to time.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall lay aſide theſe Remarks, and chuſe to come to thoſe that do not require ſo much Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor ſo great an intention of thought.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of which is, That the Moral Law was given in the ſight and hearing of all the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that the promulgation of it upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was accompanied with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry marks of Glory, and made only after many previous Purifications preſcribed to the whole Congregation in order to receive it.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, the Ceremonial Laws which were annexed to it, were not delivered to the people with ſo much Pomp and Majeſty; but as they were alſo given in the ſame Deſert, and in the preſence of the Elders of the people aſſembled together near the Tabernacle, after they had ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated <hi>Moſes,</hi> that God would no more ſpeak to them himſelf, it is evident, that they are no leſs authentick than the Moral Law, therefore we ſee that they were accordingly received by that people, notwithſtanding the Troubles, Expences, Avocations, Straights, and Hardſhips, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46528:97"/>they might meet with by it.</p>
                     <p>Now is it in the leaſt probable, that if this people had not been convinced, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally familiarly converſe with God for forty days and forty Nights upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they would fooliſhly without any cauſe, of a ſuddain, have ſubmitted to ſuch a troubleſom yoke of Laws, many whereof were oppoſite both to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Ancient Cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>It is well known for Example, what Jealouſie there was all along amongſt the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even from the time of their Anceſtors, yet we do not ſee that in thoſe Laws there is any notice taken of it, or regard had to it, but that on the contrary they ſeem to foment that Spirit of Diviſion, when they deprive <hi>Reuben</hi> of his Birthright, in favour of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Poſterity, and of the Prieſthood in favour of <hi>Levi,</hi> and of the Kingdom, in favour of <hi>Juda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, we ſee, that even after <hi>Moſes</hi> had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the difference that was once betwixt the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the followers of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> they were hardly brought to acquieſce to his Deciſion; and how could he then poſſibly have raiſed his own Tribe, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to ſuch prerogatives, and to ſuch a plentiful Condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the other Tribes, as he did by aſſigning the firſt Fruits and Offerings to the Levites and Prieſts. How could he, I ſay, have done that without meeting with ſome oppoſition from the reſt of the People, except they had all been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the Miracle that God wrought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that Queſtion, when it was diſputed, that he himſelf was the Author of that Conſtitution.</p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:46528:97"/>
                     <p>Thus we read, that long after, when King <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> boldly preſumed, to act againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXV. and to aſſume to himſelf the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Prieſthood, and to do the Functions of it; he preſently received the puniſhment due to his preſumption: So that being ſtruck with a ſuddain Leproſie, he was confined to his Dying Day. Is it any ways probable that a Prince, eſpecially of his Temper, would have ſubmitted to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and meekly reſign'd his Crown to his Son, if that puniſhment inflicted upon him, had not fully convinced him of the Divinity of that Law, which he had tranſgreſſed and violated by his Temerity and Preſumption.</p>
                     <p>The Third Reflexion is, that the greateſt part of thoſe Laws being intended by God to inſpire his people with an Irreconcileable Averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe Nations, amongſt whom they were going to ſettle; they were ſo framed, as not only to be oppoſite to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence they came, but alſo to thoſe received amongſt the <hi>Hivites, Amorites,</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of whoſe Countries they were going to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus we find in the XVIII. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> Laws againſt all Inceſtuous Marriages, which without doubt, were ordinary amongſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who therein follow'd the Examples of the Ancient Patriarchs, who Married within thoſe forbidden Degrees; there we find alſo the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to <hi>Moloch</hi> forbidden, the practice whereof, thoſe Nations, in all likelihood, defended by the Example of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Now it cannot reaſonably be thought, that a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46528:98"/>whole Nation would of a ſuddain receive ſuch Laws as deprived them of a Liberty and Freedom they had always hitherto enjoyed, and condemn of their own accord, thoſe Sacrifices that had the faireſt pretence of Religion imaginable, and to uſe many Ceremonies contrary to thoſe received amongſt them, if they had not had a ſtrong, and extraordinary Motive for ſo doing.</p>
                     <p>There is another thing beſides, that challenges our Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> the exact Deſcription which God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Tabernacle, of the ſeveral parts of the Ceremonial Worſhip, which was to be performed in that Sacred place, and of the manner how this Tabernacle with all its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, Utenſils, and Ornaments, was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                     <p>For as this Tabernacle was then the Centre of the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, (as the Temple was afterwards by ſucceeding to it) ſo it was a ſolemn proof of the Divinity of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, and of the Worſhip that was performed there.</p>
                     <p>Is it conceivable, that a whole Nation ſhould contribute to the building of it, ſhould ſee it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and taken to pieces, and ſet together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain every day, and ſhould read all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars relating to its Conſtruction, and not diſcern whether there was any truth and reality in all that was told them concerning the Religion which their Governour fixed in that place wherein he pretended many Revelations were made.</p>

                        <hi>Some other Proofs that confirm</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the manner how the Law was given and Promulgated,</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BUt if it is ſo eaſie to eſtabliſh the Divinity of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by ſhewing the truth of the Matter of Fact, according to the manner of God's Promulgation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates it, we may further collect the truth of it, by joyning theſe following Reflexions to thoſe already made in the foregoing Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Certainly if <hi>Moſes</hi> had been the firſt Founder of a Kingdom, and had been ſucceeded in it by his own Children and Poſterity for many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations one after another; we might perhaps, have had ſome ground to ſuſpect, that his Succeſſors, conſulting their own Intereſt and Honour, would have been very glad to perſwade their Subjects, that the firſt Founder of their Kingdom, had ſome Communication with God, and that it was from him he received the Laws and Conſtitutions which he gave them concerning Civil and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters.</p>
                     <p>But it is obſervable, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo far from inveſting his own Children with the Supream Authority after himſelf, that he Tranſlated it into another Tribe, and Conſtituted <hi>Joſhuah</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> for his Succeſſor in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as for his Poſterity he took little care of it,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46528:99"/>but reduced it to a Rank inferiour to that of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s Family, which he preferr'd to the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Functions of the Prieſthood; leaving to his own the meaneſt, and moſt inconſiderable Employments; all which ſhews evidently that none of thoſe who came after <hi>Moſes</hi> were moved by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private Intereſt of their own, to defend the Truth and Authority of his Laws and Writings, but only by the certain knowledge they had, that they were all Divine.</p>
                     <p>Neither ought we to omit to conſider here the manner how <hi>Moſes</hi> decides beforehand ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and determines ſuch Controverſies, as could not be raiſed, but after the Conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was made by his Succeſſor only after his Death. And how thoſe Laws were conſtantly obſerved in all the ſucceeding Generations of that people, and ſubmitted unto by the very Judges and Kings themſelves; tho there be nothing more common than for a Conqueror, ſuch as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was, to admit of no other Fundamental Laws in that State he is the Founder of, than thoſe which he is the Author of; nothing is more uſual, than for Stateſmen to affect the expoſing the Conduct of their Predeceſſors, eſpecially when the form of Government is altered, and from Democratical, or Ariſtocratical, is changed into Monarchical, as it happened amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> How then could <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws ſtill keep up their Authority in all Changes and Revolutions? How comes it to paſs, that in all the Succeſſions of Judges and Kings, there was never any of them attempted to ſuſpend, or annul <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, much leſs to enact and give any others contrary to them?</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:46528:99"/>
                     <p>Again, how came it to paſs, that in all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Factions that Nation fell into, there was never any <hi>Jew,</hi> endeavour'd with any ſucceſs, to undeceive the reſt of his own people, ſo as to make them ſhake off the troubleſom Yoke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Laws. No doubt only, becauſe the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Nation never diſputed the Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and Authority of them.</p>
                     <p>It were an eaſie thing to demonſtrate by the whole Series, of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory, that all thoſe Laws which in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings are inlay'd one within another, and repreſented as occaſion'd by ſeveral Tranſactions related there, have all been equally received of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and have all been put together in a Body by themſelves before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Death, as it may be proved out of the XXXI. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appears, that thoſe Laws were publick, and in great eſteem amongſt that People, to whom God gave them, upon whom he laid an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Obligation to read them every day, and to conſult them upon every emergent buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that they were known equally of all degrees of Men, Sexes, and Ages, which were all obliged to pay Obedience to them upon pain of Death.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that thoſe Laws were not only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly kept in the Tabernacle, but alſo privately read in every Family.</p>
                     <p>We ſee, that a whole Tribe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was appointed by God to explain them, and in order to that they were diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and exempted from the Cares and Troubles that neceſſarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46528:100"/>Husbandry, by the plentiful Proviſion of Tithes and Offerings that was allotted to them.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that God obliged all <hi>Jews</hi> to read and meditate upon them continually, eſpecially every Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>Nay, and we ſee moreover, that God every Seventh Year would have them read publickly in a more ſolemn manner, before the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of that people, who during that Year, were obliged to reſt from all their ordinary La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Employments, and ſo had nothing elſe to do all that while, but to read the Law, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and to meditate upon it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It appears, that thoſe Laws were yet the more Solemn and Authentick, becauſe they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to celebrate three ſuch Feaſts as were to be publickly kept by the whole Nation, and conſequently apt to refreſh their Memories, and put them in mind, thrice a year, not only of the ſurprizing Miracles that God had done for them; but alſo of the manner how he gave and promulgated his Laws; the Miracles giving riſe to the Laws, and thoſe Laws being themſelves a means of preſerving the Memory of thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, becauſe of the frequent Commemoration of them which was therein enjoyned.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe things being ſo, let every one judge, whether the truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Account of God's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and promulgating by his means that Body of Laws which he hath inſerted in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the following Books, can poſſibly, or at leaſt, reaſonably be diſputed, or doubted of. But I come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Oracles recorded in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings in order to demonſtrate the Truth and Divinity of them.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of Oracles in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the other three following Books.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There are ſome whereof the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did ſoon follow the Prediction.</p>
                     <p>The Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Bondage is of that number; <hi>Moſes</hi> does promiſe and foretel it; nay, and he executed it himſelf: And all the people to whom it was promiſed and foretold, were themſelves Witneſſes of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that Propheſie; and it was that accompliſhment which eſtabliſhed the Divinity of his Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>So is the other Propheſie concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that were to be made of it amongſt all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael, Moſes</hi> foretelling exactly what Lot every one ſhould have, and giving beſides, a Deſcription of the Countrey that every Tribe was to inhabit.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that were Born in the Deſert, were Witneſſes both of the Prediction, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, altho it was by the caſting of Lots, that all the Tribes got their ſeveral Partitions.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, There are ſome other Oracles in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46528:101"/>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Books, the accompliſhment whereof was not to follow the Prediction till after a long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time.</p>
                     <p>Such are the Propheſies that foretel the future Subjection of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the ſeveral Deliverances out of that Subjection, which God was to effect by the hands of <hi>Judges,</hi> whom he was to raiſe up for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Such again are the Propheſies which relate to the future change of their Common wealth into a Kingly Government.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, We ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> foretells all the Accidents, Changes, and Revolutions that were to befal the <hi>Jews</hi> as long as their State ſhould ſtand: At leaſt, we ſee that his Predictions are very plain, concerning their ſeveral Captivities, and Removals, and their return into the Holy Land; as alſo the Sieges of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the irrecoverable diſperſion of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we ſee at preſent.</p>
                     <p>But whatever difference there may otherwiſe be, betwixt all theſe Predictions, we may ſay, that every one of them, hath as pregnant Proofs of its certainty and truth, as any thing of that nature is capable of.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, As to the firſt ſort of Predictions, the accompliſhment whereof, <hi>Moſes</hi> relates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>It plainly appears, that his account, cannot in the leaſt be ſuſpected of Impoſture; becauſe he wrote it amongſt a whole Nation, which could not poſſibly be impoſed upon in that caſe, ſeeing he ſuppoſes, and takes it for granted, all along in his Relation, that thoſe Predictions were before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46528:101"/>publickly and generally known of all the people.</p>
                     <p>As for the accompliſhment of the ſecond ſort of Propheſies, we have the Relation of it in ſuch other Books as were written after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Death, as in the Books of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of <hi>Judges,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which relate the accompliſhment of them, as of Propheſies written many years, and even ſome Ages before, by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, to this we may add, that the account which we find in thoſe Books, concerning the accompliſhment of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Propheſies, is interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with ſuch Hiſtories, as ſuppoſe, without any Affectation, that his Propheſies, as well as his Writings, were in the hands of all the World, and diſtinctly known by every <hi>Jew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what is further obſervable, is, That the <hi>Jews</hi> have always had <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Books in ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, becauſe of theſe ſeveral Illuſtrious Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that are contained in them, that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lookt upon him as the moſt excellent of all their Prophets. They aſſert at this very day, that the other Prophets had commonly no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of future Events, than that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them by Dreams and Viſions; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> had it by an immediate Revelation of God himſelf, who uſed to ſpeak to him Face to Face, without any Enthuſiaſm when he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly awake.</p>
                     <p>Now, how could ever the <hi>Jews</hi> have been ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſt of that high Opinion both of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Predictions, if we ſuppoſe, that they never ſaw the accompliſhment of any of them?</p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46528:102"/>
                     <p>That would certainly be as ſtrange an Illuſion as ever was: For it is beſides obſervable, that thoſe Propheſies of his, were not written by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and kept ſecret from the generality of the people; but that they were inſerted into the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Speeches which he made to all the people ſome time before his Death; and which are written, and kept together in the ſame Volume, to be a ſtanding Monument, both of his Prophecies, and of his Miniſtry among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there is a vaſt Difference betwixt a Book that is all made up of Propheſies, and ſo kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and ſeldom read, as the Books of the Sybils were; and a Book wherein the Propheſies it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, are interwoven with a Hiſtory, wherein there is ſo great a variety of Matters, as draws to it, and fixes the attention of every Reader; and wherein they are mingled with a whole Body of Political and Ceremonial Laws; and intermixed with the accounts which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of all the great Tranſactions which gave the occaſion to ſo many ſeveral Revelations and Propheſies recorded in his Books.</p>
                     <p>I am perſwaded, that it is impoſſible for any Man to make thoſe Reflexions upon the Opinion which the <hi>Jews</hi> entertained of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and upon the manner that his Propheſies, ſo much reverenced amongſt them, were exactly accompliſhed, and not be convinced of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</p>

                        <hi>That the Teſtimony of the</hi> Jews, <hi>is a conſtant proof of the truth of the Oracles related by</hi> Moſes.</head>
                     <p>BUt leaſt any Body ſhould think it ſtrange, that I ſhould build the truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, upon the Teſtimony of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain its authority of it within juſt, and certain Bounds.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Although the <hi>Jews</hi> bear Witneſs in their Sacred Books, that the greateſt part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prophecies are already fulfill'd, yet they ſay ſome are not: As for inſtance thoſe which relate to the Meſſiah's coming. But their obſtinate blindneſs, is not a juſt prejudice againſt ſuch an important truth, to be convinced of which, we need only to compare <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Words, with the Actions of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus for what relates to the Deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> we need only compare <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Propheſie of it, with the Deſcription <hi>Joſephus</hi> their own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, hath made of the ſame in his Hiſtory of the Siege and ruine of that City, and of the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all the Nations of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But without the <hi>Jews</hi> Teſtimony, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the accompliſhment of thoſe Propheſies, whereof the execution was deferred for a very long time, it is eaſie to convince any the moſt Incredulous Man of their Truth and Divinity, if
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46528:103"/>he pleaſe but to make this one Reflexion, which is, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> relates amongſt the Oracles of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> a particular Propheſie concerning the Meſſiah's coming, and when he mentions that of <hi>Balaam</hi> concerning the riſing of that Divine Star, he ſubjoins alſo at the ſame time that concerning the Vocation of the Gentiles to the Faith, and brings it in as a certain ſign and conſequence of the Meſſiah's being come into the World.</p>
                     <p>Now if we examine the meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, about the Vocation of the Gentiles, which the Prophets that came after him did better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and illuſtrate, we ſhall be apt from thence to conclude, that he in effect foretold, that God in the days of the Meſſiah would follow quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Method, than that which he had uſed before until the time of <hi>Moſes, viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That whereas God might ſeem to reſtrain then the Priviledge of his Covenant, to one people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; which was in effect to reſtrain the honour of the Meſſiah's Birth, to one ſole Nation of the World, to one ſole Tribe of that Nation, to one ſole Family of that Tribe, to one ſole Branch of that Family, and ſo to one ſole perſon of that Branch: He would (after the Meſſiah's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) take a contrary Method, and call all men to Salvation in him.</p>
                     <p>Now that being ſuppoſed, the truth of all <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Propheſies cannot be queſtion'd. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Jews</hi> Opinion be concerning the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſome of them: It is ſufficient for us, that they have carefully and faithfully preſerved the Books, wherein thoſe Prophecies, which we ſee ſo exactly fulfilled, are contained.</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:46528:103"/>
                     <p>For, we cannot reaſonably ſuſpect <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other <hi>Jew</hi> of forging the Propheſies which foretold the calling of the Gentiles, not <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Laws do tend (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter more at large) to eſtabliſh that reſtriction, I was juſt now ſpeaking of, which was to continue to the Meſſiah's coming. Not the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing that none of them can ſtill endure to hear of the removal of that Reſtriction, by the calling of the Gentiles; and that they are all poſſeſt with ſuch a Spirit of Envy and Jealouſie againſt all other Nations, that they perfectly hate and abominate them. But beſides, we cannot deſire a better, nor a more authentick accompliſhment of thoſe Oracles, which are ſo oppoſite to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Prejudices, than that which we our ſelves are Witneſſes of.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Reflexion belongs to the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the total Diſſipation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State; as alſo to the dreadful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of them in our days. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Obſtinacy can ſuggeſt but one Objection in this matter, which is, that either the Chriſtians, or the Jews have falſified <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings, and inſerted thoſe Propheſies, which we now find there, concerning the Vocation of the Gentiles, and the diſperſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after thoſe things were come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>But Firſt, The Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which both Chriſtians and Jews have, are Written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and penn'd in ſuch a Stile as evidences their Antiquity, and as would be inimitable now.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That theſe Books have been all Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46528:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>into Greek, almoſt 300 years before Jeſus Chriſt, and about 350 years before the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Neither the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor yet the Chriſtians were any longer ſole Maſters of them, when the Heathens had them alſo in their hands.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, thoſe who were Converted to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity from Judaiſm and Heatheniſm, did not only find theſe Propheſies of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the hands of <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens, long before the Converſion of the Gentiles, and the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but did alſo make uſe of them to evince againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Meſſiah was already come.</p>
                     <p>Thus, I think, I have ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Truth and Divinity of all <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies which we find in <hi>Exodus</hi> and the following Books.</p>

                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>That it appears by the nature of his Relations, that</hi> Moſes <hi>had the Meſſias in view when he wrote the Book of</hi> Geneſis.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſhew'd in my former Reflexions upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that thoſe who lived before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, had a diſtinct knowledge that God would certainly raiſe up a Deliverer amongſt them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not certain of the manner of his appearance. And I have beſides, I think,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46528:104"/>ſufficiently proved, that the various Idea's which the Ancients entertained of him upon the firſt Promiſe made by God of his coming, were the occaſion of ſeveral Criminal Actions committed by the Patriarchs, and by thoſe of other Nations, who had the ſame pretenſions with them.</p>
                     <p>I am now to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had the ſame knowledge, and lived in the ſame expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Ancients that preceded him. It is of more importance to be ſhewn, and that henceforth no Body may wonder, if I pretend that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Laws he gave to the <hi>Jews,</hi> both in reference to Civil and Religious Matters, and the greateſt part of his Propheſies, as alſo thoſe others mentioned by Prophets that lived after him in that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-wealth, do all ſuppoſe a diſtinct relation to the promiſed Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>And to make this evident, I beg leave to offer to the Reader's Conſideration ſome general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, It cannot be denied that <hi>Moſes</hi> was one of the greateſt and wiſeſt Hiſtorians that ever was: There cannot be a greater deſign, nor a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Task than his was to write the Hiſtory of 2400 years: He gives an account of the Creation of the World in general; and in particular, of that of Man, of his ſin, of the Promiſe God made him after the Fall, of the Flood, of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all the Nations that were in his time.</p>
                     <p>His way and manner of Writing is alſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: The Majeſty of his Stile is tempered with an admirable plainneſs; he deſcribes all ſorts of Paſſions to the Life; he is admirable in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Men he ſpeaks of, and of God
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46528:105"/>himſelf. To be convinced of this, let any Man read his Deſcription of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sacrifice, and of the ſeveral Paſſions <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren were moved and affected with, when he made himſelf known to them. Beſides all that we may obſerve two very ſurprizing things in the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> recites there ſuch things as ſeem to be unworthy to be taken notice of, by ſo Grave and Wiſe a Hiſtorian as he was: He gives for inſtance, an exact and particular account of all the Circumſtances of <hi>Ahraham</hi>'s Purchaſe of the Cave of <hi>Machpela,</hi> for a Burying place for his Wife: He ſets down all the particulars of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of <hi>Judah</hi> with <hi>Thamar;</hi> and he relates the manner how <hi>Leah</hi> with her Sons Mandrakes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave of <hi>Rachel</hi> to enjoy her Husband for one Night, with a ſurprizing exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>The other is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> records a whole Series of horrible Crimes, which ſeem to be as ſo many blemiſhes and odious Reflexions upon the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe whoſe Hiſtory he writes.</p>
                     <p>Now it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> being ſo prudent, as he is confeſſed to be, could have been ſo injudicious, as to chuſe and pick out ſuch Paſſages and Actions as are in themſelves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trivial and of no moment, or horrible and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, to fill up with them a Book wherein he gives a Deſcription of the Creation of the World, where he ſets down the Oracles of God at every turn.</p>
                     <p>It is natural therefore to judge, that he had ſome particular proſpect in his Eyes, which could be no other than that of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which alone
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46528:105"/>juſtifies his recital of trivial things, and of Crimes in ſuch a ſerious Hiſtory as his is.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not repeat here what I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon the Crimes which he relates in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> I add only, that he had the ſame deſign and proſpect in his Narration of ſuch ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Tranſactions.</p>
                     <p>Thus by his account of the purchaſe of the Cave of <hi>Machpelah,</hi> his intention was to ſhew how God intended by this Sepulchre, to affix <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity after him to the Land of <hi>Cannaan:</hi> his Scope and Proſpect was the ſame when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords the Burial of <hi>Rachel</hi> at <hi>Ephrathah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Crimes <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, I have before proved, that he deſign'd thereby to ſhew, how all the Faithful before his time, had their minds alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken up with the thoughts and hopes of the accompliſhment of the Promiſe: And herein we may ſay, the Wiſdom of <hi>Moſes</hi> is very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and diſcernable in the choice he made of thoſe Actions to perpetuate the Memory of the exceſſive deſire which the Ancients had to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And let no Man object here, that it is very ſtrange to ſee, that during ſo many Ages, the Promiſe of the Meſſiah occaſioned no other than wicked actions. For as it appears by all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that thoſe Crimes related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were committed in different times, and long after one another, ſo it is plain, that he hath recorded thoſe Actions on purpoſe, to ſhew what impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the true knowledge of the Promiſe of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah made upon the mind of thoſe that had it in its perfection and integrity.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:46528:106"/>
                     <p>If <hi>Moſes</hi> had inſerted in this Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> any long Diſcourſe as made by <hi>Adam</hi> about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a Sabbath day, or if he had given us a Relation of what ſuch an one as <hi>Seth,</hi> or <hi>Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Sem</hi> uſed to teach concerning that Promiſe in their Religious Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, That beſides the inconvenience of a tedious Repetition which he muſt have made of the ſame things in every particular account he gives of the ſeveral Generations that preceded him, he could never have perſwaded his Readers ſo well as he may do now.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Men would have been apt to ſuſpect, that thoſe Speeches upon the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, were of his own making, and like thoſe Set Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues we find in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Livy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Crimes that were committed, to get thereby ſome advantage: As for Inſtance, The Murder of a King committed by his Heir, and Succeſſor to the Crown, ſhews in the Murder a much greater Ambition, and Affectation of the Throne; and ſuppoſes in him a diſtinct and clear knowledge of his Rights and Pretenſions to the Empire.</p>

                        <hi>That the ſame Perſwaſion appears throughout the whole Conduct of</hi> Moſes, <hi>until his Death.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BUt it is not only by thoſe and the like Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may be made upon the choice, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath made of the things which he recites, that we may gather that he had always the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Meſſiah in view; for he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> there is no doubt, but that from his Youth up, he was brought up in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and conſequently in the hopes of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</p>
                     <p>But moreover we have reaſon to think, that the Idea of this Promiſe of the Meſſiah, was much more lively and ſtrong in that Family, ever ſince <hi>Jacob</hi> on his Death-Bed had foretold, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Judah,</hi> that it was out of his Tribe he was to be Born. As for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to whom that Promiſe might have been applied by the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of his Power and Glory in <hi>Egypt;</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Perſecution that followed ſometime after his Deceaſe, reſolved all Scruples and Miſtakes that might otherwiſe have been entertained in that matter, and ſo convinced all thoſe poor Sufferers, that their Meſſiah was as yet to come.</p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:46528:107"/>
                     <p>To all theſe ſtrong Preſumptions whereby we may gueſs, what the thoughts of <hi>Moſes</hi> might be, concerning the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, we may add the Conſideration both of his Words and Actions, which do very plainly eſtabliſh the ſame Truth.</p>
                     <p>St.
<note place="margin">Heb. XI.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>hebrews,</hi> mentions two particular Actions of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which, as they challenge our Admiration, ſo they deſerve our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration, becauſe they clearly, I think, evidence, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was fully perſwaded of the future accompliſhment of that Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That he refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, chuſing rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Affliction with the people of God, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for he had reſpect unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of the Reward. From whence could a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſo oppoſite to the ordinary prudence, and natural inclinations of other Men proceed in him, if it was not, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves it, from a very extraordinary Source, <hi>viz.</hi> from that ſtrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion which he had, that how calamitous ſoever the then preſent condition of the people of God might be, yet God had choſen it therein to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that great promiſe which was the Joy of all their Anceſtors from <hi>Adam</hi> down to them, the remembrance whereof he renewed, by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating thoſe Oracles which <hi>Jacob</hi> pronounced upon his Death-Bed.</p>
                     <p>The other is, That <hi>Moſes</hi> always adhered to that Miſerable people, and ſtood by them in all their Calamities and Preſſures. 'Tis true, he left
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46528:107"/>them, and retired once into <hi>Midian</hi> to ſave his Life, and avoid the King's Indignation, but he returned to them into <hi>Egypt</hi> as ſoon as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Commiſſion from God, to deliver them out of their Miſery and Bondage: Now he ſhew'd again, by ſo doing, that he had a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that great Promiſe of God made to that people, and a full aſſurance and perſwaſion of its future accompliſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us indeed, how he refuſed at firſt the Commiſſion God gave him to deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, and how he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf upon his own incapacity, and being unfit for ſo great an undertaking: But yet he makes at the ſame time ſo viſible an Alluſion to the Propheſie concerning the <hi>Shiloh</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſent) <hi>O my Lord,</hi> (ſaid he, to God) <hi>ſend, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend,</hi> that he could hardly expreſs and declare his mind about it more plainly.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall be the better convinced of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the ſending of the <hi>Shiloh;</hi> if we reflect upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s being of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> of which God had pronounced nothing concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accompliſhment of the Promiſe, he could not be ignorant of his being himſelf Excluded of that Priviledge, and that after all, what glory ſoever the Miraculous preſervation, and Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beginnings of his Life, might ſeem to pretend and promiſe to him, yet he could not expect to riſe much higher than <hi>Joſeph</hi> had done before him, altho he would reaſſume the former Poſt, to which his Adoption by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter had once raiſed him.</p>

                     <p>We ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> continued always of the ſame mind, and entertained ſtill the ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hopes of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, even after God had revealed to him, that the time of his appearing into the World, was not yet come: This, I ſay, we ſee by his Speech to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> related in the XVIII.

                        <hi>That</hi> Balaam<hi>'s Propheſie, which</hi> Moſes <hi>relates, is a further Argument of the ſame perſwaſion in him.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS we ought to ſhew that <hi>Moſes</hi> had a very clear and diſtinct knowledge of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; ſo I think it will not be amiſs to make here
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46528:108"/>a particular Reflexion upon what he relates <hi>Numb.</hi> XXIII.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moabites</hi> being deſcended from <hi>Lot</hi>'s eldeſt Daughter, it is very natural to conceive, that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> their King was ſo deſirous to have the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> curſed from God, and by one of his Prophets on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he deſign'd thereby to ſecure himſelf of the Divine Bleſſing; or which is the ſame thing, of the priviledge of the accompliſhment of the Promiſe, to which he thought he had a juſt claim and pretenſion by his being one of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>And this Obſervation upon <hi>Balac</hi>'s pretenſion and action, is the more juſt, and well grounded becauſe the Notion of the Curſe which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have had pronounced againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> is directly oppoſite to the terms of the Promiſe which God made to <hi>Abraham, in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> which words, as I obſerved before, do import a direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to <hi>Lot</hi>'s pretenſion.</p>
                     <p>Now all this being ſuppoſed, one needs only conſider the terms of the Propheſie ſpoken by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> in favour of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it, only to ſhew,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That altho thoſe Neighbouring Nations to <hi>Judea</hi> had degenerated, and corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much by their Communication with <hi>Ham</hi>'s Poſterity, yet they preſerved a ſtrong, though confuſed Notion of their Anceſtors pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and acted according to that prejudice of theirs in all Matters and Occurrences of great moment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it might be an Authentick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of all the ſeveral Conteſts and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46528:109"/>which had divided the Poſterity of <hi>Terah</hi> until that time.</p>
                     <p>It is like a Definitive Sentence; firſt in favour of <hi>Abraham</hi> againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> who were deſcended from <hi>Lot:</hi> Secondly, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> againſt the pretenſion of the <hi>Iſmael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Iſmael:</hi> Thirdly, In favour of <hi>Jacob,</hi> againſt the pretenſion of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For when he foretels, that there ſhall come a Star out of <hi>Jacob;</hi> he decides the three forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Controverſies. <hi>Jacob</hi> having been preferred to <hi>Eſau, Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot.</hi> Now <hi>Jacob</hi> could not be preferr'd to the <hi>Moabites,</hi> but he muſt be ſo too to the <hi>Ammonites, Iſmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Propheſie, as any one may ſee, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, becauſe it reſolves all the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Controverſies, which did excite ſo many Jealouſies amongſt all thoſe Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>This Oracle of <hi>Balaam</hi> is yet the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe, that notwithſtanding it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at the entry into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the poſſeſſing and inhabiting of which Countrey was one of the chiefeſt Characters of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> diſtinction from all other Nations, yet in it <hi>Balaam</hi> makes a very diſtinct mention of the future calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to the Faith; he calls them the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> to intimate that in the time of the Meſſiah, the reſtriction made and obſerved by God before that time, was then to ceaſe, and that there ſhould be no more diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, who were all the Children of <hi>Noah,</hi> and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46528:109"/>all equally deſcended from <hi>Seth</hi> by him, becauſe then all Nations were to be call'd to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know that ſome by the Children of <hi>Seth</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Inhabitants of a certain Town in the Countrey of <hi>Moab,</hi> mentioned in the XV. of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> according to the Septuagint.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Arabian</hi> Interpreter of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Abuſaid. M.S.</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> King's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, Note 4. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gen. IV. 26.</note> brings very good Arguments to prove, that that place of Scripture is to be underſtood of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and ſhews that he is call'd the head of the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> becauſe <hi>Seth</hi> was the head, and common Father of all Men ſince the Flood, and at the ſame time of all the faithful before the Flood; and that thoſe words of <hi>Geneſis</hi> IV. 26. <hi>Then began Men to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> relate to <hi>Seth,</hi> and not to <hi>Enos,</hi> as it is commonly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this Propheſie by theſe words, <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now. I ſhall behold him, but not nigh,</hi> determines, that the Birth of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was not near, but was reſerved for a further time.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is a very ſingular thing, that this Oracle ſhould be repreſented to us, as coming out of the Mouth of a Prophet, who was choſen by God out of the Family of <hi>Abraham;</hi> becauſe the Author of it decides theſe Important Queſtions and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without any viſible partiality, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by aſſed by the pretenſions of his Birth.</p>
                     <p>Now there are three things in it which clearly prove, that it could not be unknown to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That immediately after this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which was as publick and well known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46528:110"/>the <hi>Moabites,</hi> as any Propheſie could be; after the tedious preparation, and the many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which <hi>Balaam</hi> made to come to <hi>Balac:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the many Ceremonies and Myſteries which he uſed upon that occaſion; and notwithſtanding the great and panick terror of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> at the approach of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> Nay, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſs Threats, and Ominous Propheſies of <hi>Balaam</hi> againſt that people; notwithſtanding all this, I ſay, we ſee the Daughters of <hi>Moab</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the carnal prudence of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Daughters, and courting the alliance of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as if they had had a mind to make themſelves amends that way, for the loſs and wrong they had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sentence which <hi>Balaam</hi> pronounced in favour of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee, I ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> immediately after he had related the Prophecies of <hi>Balaam,</hi> tells us, that the Daughters of <hi>Moab</hi> invited the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Sacrifices of their Gods, and that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> accepted of the invitation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly feaſted, and began then to defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Daughters of <hi>Moab.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, that ſuch a thing ſhould happen preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Balaam</hi> had uttered his Propheſie, ſhews evidently, that there was ſome Relation betwixt thoſe two Tranſactions. And this may be further made out, from the manner and nature of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which God inflicted upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their Criminal Commerce with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> although the pretence of it might be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſign which the Daughters of <hi>Moab</hi> had formed according to the Principles of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to ſhare in the accompliſhment of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46528:110"/>Promiſe, by their conceiving and getting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by thoſe whom <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Propheſie had inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the right and priviledge of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That accordingly about two hundred years after <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſee that <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs</hi> left her own Country to ſettle and live at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and affected beſides to marry there again, one of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> no doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had got in her own Country a certain knowledge of that famous Oracle, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made her eaſily yield to the Counſels, and receive Inſtructions both of her Mother in Law, and of her own Husband, who was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and no doubt, had the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein were inſerted, both the Propheſie of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in favour of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that of <hi>Balaam,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt the <hi>Moabites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third is, That the <hi>Jews</hi> have now for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages conſtantly maintained,
<note place="margin">I Kings II. 8.</note> that <hi>Simei</hi>'s Curſes againſt <hi>David,</hi> which afterwards he called <hi>Maledictionem peſſimam,</hi>

                     <p>No Body can condemn this Reflexion upon <hi>Ruth,</hi> if he will but conſider, that her Faith ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo rewarded, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came our of her Poſterity; ſhe is particularly made mention of in his Genealogy; and that on the other hand her Hiſtory hath been preſerved amongſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books of the Old Teſtament, as a kind of preſcription, not only againſt the <hi>Moabites</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, long before condemned by <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but alſo againſt thoſe of the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> who had no better claim to the Promiſe than the <hi>Moabites,</hi> having no other than that of a general Call, and of their Birthright before <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Poſterity.</p>

                     <p>IT was altogether neceſſary for the execution of my deſign, to eſtabliſh well, the Authority of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46528:112"/>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Books, upon which I intend to make ſome Reflexions: It was likewiſe neceſſary to ſhew, as I think I have done ſufficiently, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was perfectly acquainted with God's Promiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah. Therefore, I believe, I may now come to ſhew, that both <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe that came after him, had all an Eye upon the Meſſiah in their chiefeſt Regulations.</p>
                     <p>But to give a greater inſight, and underſtanding into the things that I am to ſay, I think it may not be amiſs, to remind the Reader, and to lay before him once more, the ſeveral Characters of God's Conduct in that matter, that he may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge of the whole Series of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                     <p>I have heretofore ſhew'd, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s intention was to eſtabliſh two things in the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The one, that all Men have derived their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from <hi>Adam,</hi> whom God Created.</p>
                     <p>The other, That Men having ſinned, God promiſed to reinſtate him by one of his own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe, was then ſolidly proved by a plain matter of Fact, when I ſhew'd, that ſuch a Tradition as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates about the Creation of the World, cannot reaſonably be doubted of.</p>
                     <p>As for what concerns the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Meſſiah, which was the chiefeſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Man's hope and comfort: I have alſo ſhew'd, I think, that the Notion, and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was very ſtrong and lively, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſe of all the extraordinary Actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:46528:113"/>
                     <p>But as this promiſe was not to be fulfilled for many Ages; ſo God made it only in very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, and had ſtill reſerved to himſelf the Revelation for after Ages, as he thought fit, both as to the manner and time of its accompliſhment. It is therefore abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould conſider alſo how God preſerved all along the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge of it amongſt men.</p>
                     <p>Now in reading my Reflexions upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> one muſt needs have obſerved that God, even in thoſe early times of the World, did reſtrain the priviledge of accompliſhing that promiſe by little and little to ſome particular Men; till at laſt he openly declared, that he had ſetled it in the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> as we read it <hi>Gen.</hi> XLIX.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that God in the very beginning of the World reſtrained that Prerogative to <hi>Seth</hi>'s Family, and excluded <hi>Cain</hi>'s from it; then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of all <hi>Seth</hi>'s Family he reſtrained it to <hi>Noah</hi> alone and his Family; then of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family to <hi>Shem</hi> alone; then afterwards of all <hi>Shem</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to <hi>Abraham</hi> alone; then of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sons, to <hi>Iſaac</hi> alone; and of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, to <hi>Jacob</hi> alone; whoſe Son <hi>Judah</hi> was alone inveſted with that priviledge, and all his Brethren excluded.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover obſervable, that in thoſe ſeven forementioned Reſtrictions which God made, he ſeems to have affected, to prefer the youngeſt to the eldeſt; as it is evident in his choice, if not of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Shem,</hi> who was elder than the other Sons; yet certainly in that of <hi>Seth,</hi> who was younger than <hi>Cain;</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the youngeſt of <hi>Terah</hi>'s Sons; of <hi>Iſaac</hi> who was youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than <hi>Iſmael;</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> who was younger than
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46528:113"/>
                        <hi>Eſau;</hi> and of <hi>Judah</hi> who was one of the youngeſt of <hi>Leah</hi>'s Sons.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe if the Reader would judge of God's deſign, by the event alone, he might juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God by this affected choice intended to raiſe continual Jealouſies betwixt the Eldeſt (who pretended that the priviledge of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe, did belong to them becauſe of their Birthright) againſt their youngeſt Brothers, whom they ſaw preſerred by God's immediate choice.</p>
                     <p>One may alſo further add, That God ſeems to have ſtrengthen'd theſe Jealouſies, by introducing ſometimes a ſort of Conformity amongſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the execution of this promiſe: Thus, for inſtance, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Children, ſo <hi>Lot</hi> had two; as <hi>Jacob</hi> had twelve Sons, ſo <hi>Eſau</hi> alſo had twelve; and ſometimes one may find, that thoſe particular perſons who are preferred, are charged with very ſevere Accuſations.</p>
                     <p>Now after all theſe general Refiexions, it is natural for us to conſider, what care God hath upon all occaſions particularly taken, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and protect, thoſe whom he had inveſted with the right of accompliſhing the Promiſe, that their ſtate and ſucceſſion might never be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>'Twas this deſign, no doubt, which obliged God to make <hi>Seth</hi> the Depoſitary of his Service and Worſhip, that he might thereby ſave <hi>Noah</hi> from the Flood, and ſo procure to <hi>Shem</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>'Twas for this Reaſon that he call'd <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his own Countrey, and made him Travel
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46528:114"/>from place to place to make him thereby famous in the World, and to invite Men by that means to inquire after his Profeſſion, his Hopes, and his Religion.</p>
                     <p>Again, it was for this, that he obliged this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch to the practice of Circumciſion, which was a real diſtinction, and an indelible Character, and that he likewiſe confined him to a certain place, by fixing him in ſome ſort to the Cave of <hi>Machpela,</hi> which he had purchaſed of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Hamor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It was for that reaſon, that God would have the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> diſtinguiſhed from all other Nations of the World, and that he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited all alliance with them, as alſo all Imitations of the Cuſtoms, and Religious Ceremonies pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Now all this being ſuppoſed, I ſay, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the end and principal deſign of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, or whether we examine his ſeveral Propheſies, which do particularly characterize the Meſſiah; we ſhall find that God did all along continue in his firſt deſign of diſtinction; and conſequently of keeping up the Jealouſies of thoſe that had any pretenſions to the priviledge of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the Promiſe; or which is all one, that he hath proſecuted the ſame deſign to Jeſus Chriſt's time, in whom Chriſtians do maintain, that the firſt Promiſe was accompliſhed, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then, and not till then, both put an end to all thoſe Differences and Diſtinctions, which were only intended to make the Meſſiah the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known, and the more certainly diſcerned at his coming, and then to ceaſe; juſt as Scaffolds
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46528:114"/>are taken away as ſoon as the Building is finiſhed: And having alſo on the other hand rectified the Principles from which flowed that Spirit of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, amongſt thoſe who had the ſame preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>We ſee, that accordingly God excluded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations from the right of accompliſhing this Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>We ſee, that even in the Family of <hi>Judah,</hi> who was himſelf the youngeſt of the firſt Set of <hi>Leah</hi>'s Children, he reſtrained the execution of it to the youngeſt Brothers.</p>
                     <p>We ſee, that he raiſed occaſions of Jealouſies, even amongſt the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word, we ſee, that of all thoſe means which can diſtinguiſh any one people from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations of the World, or one Tribe from twelve, one Family from all other Families of the ſame Tribe; and one particular perſon, from all the reſt of his Family, none were omitted, but (on the contrary) all made uſe of by God, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this his firſt deſign.</p>
                     <p>This I intend firmly to eſtabliſh, by examining the thing gradually from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, (by whoſe Miniſtry God enacted, and publiſhed thoſe Laws, by the means whereof, he intended the Meſſiah might certainly be known) to the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom we believe, that the Promiſe was accompliſhed.</p>

                        <hi>That the manner of God's Promulgating his Law amongſt the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>did much conduce to the diſtinguiſhing them from all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Do not barely deſign here at firſt to obſerve the ſeveral Reſemblances, which are obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble betwixt the things related by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and thoſe which one finds in the following Books.</p>
                     <p>Neither will I meerly eſtabliſh here that, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with all his Children, and the protection that they all received there, from <hi>Joſeph,</hi> did ſerve to fulfil the Prediction which God made of that Event by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dreams; ſo we may ſay in general, that the ſending of <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Miracles, and his whole Miniſtry to the time of his Death, when he entruſted <hi>Joſhuah</hi> with the Conduct of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were a litteral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the firſt part of the Promiſe, which God had formerly made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the fourth Generation of his Poſterity out of the Captivity, which it was to fall into, and then to bring it into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed repreſents that people according to the Tenour of the Propheſie, as groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hard preſſure of a cruel Captivity in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:46528:115"/>when <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his eminent Services were both forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards he tells us, how they were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly delivered out of that Captivity.</p>
                     <p>And then Laſtly he informs us, that after he had carried them through many difficulties in the Wilderneſs he brought them at laſt to the very Borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo left them ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and poſſeſs it, according to God's Promiſes, and their pretenſions grounded upon thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which had been ſo often repeated to them ever ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſhua, Moſes</hi> Succeſſour, and in all likelihood, the Author of the Deſcription of his Death, is he that accompliſhed the other part of God's promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> by introducing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and actually poſſeſſing them of it: So there is nothing can be imagined more preciſe in this whole matter.</p>
                     <p>But it is not all this only that renders both the perſon and Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo glorious: There are ſeveral other things in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and his other following Books, which do much better deſerve our Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Books contain, as I have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an exact Hiſtory, of all that God did in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give a certain form to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a fixed place, and a particular Service, that is in order to follow his great deſign of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Meſſiah known without miſtake, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould be Born amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and this is my chiefeſt aim in the Reflexions upon <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and the other Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, we might ſay in general, That the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46528:116"/>of the Sabbath, and the uſe of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jews;</hi> but yet, I have ſhew'd, that the Sabbath was a Law common to all Nations in the World, and that Circumciſion on the other hand was common both to the <hi>Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> and <hi>Edomites:</hi> And this will oblige us to make ſome particular Obſervations upon that matter; and we muſt conſider how God took care to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh that people, by giving them his Law.</p>
                     <p>It is in general evident, that the care which God took to give the Moral Law to that whole people, did eminently diſtinguiſh them from all other Nations, whom he permitted to walk in their own ways, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it; to be ſure it ſhews them that he reſolved to fix them to himſelf, and to hinder them from following, both the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of other Nations, and thoſe Inundations of Vice, which ruine all Societies.</p>
                     <p>And without doubt, the ſurprizing pomp which accompanied the promulgation of God's Law, and which was recorded by his order, before thoſe that had been the Eye-witneſſes of it, did much contribute to perſwade them that God had a particular regard and kindneſs for their Nation, and that he honoured them with his particular Guidance.</p>
                     <p>We may make the ſame Obſervation upon God's giving them a Political Law, and upon the care that he was alſo pleaſed to take of regulating their Civil Government, and preventing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which are commonly occaſioned by ſuch Accidents as cannot be foreſeen by any Human Legiſlators, which cauſe great Revolutions and Changes in all Governments, all which ſhew ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46528:116"/>that his deſign was to raiſe them up to, and to maintain them in as great proſperity and welfare, as poſſibly could be procured to a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by perfect Laws, and a well Conſtituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; even the many Ceremonies which God gave them, are a further Demonſtration of God's deſign to diſtinguiſh them from other Nations.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems not to have been God's intention at firſt to lay upon them ſuch numbers of Ceremonies: For it was only after the Commiſſion of the ſin of the Golden Calf, that God laid upon them that heavy and troubleſome yoak, on purpoſe to imploy all their time, and ſo keep them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Idolatry again. But however <hi>Tanchuma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jalkut.</hi> in <hi>Pent.</hi> fol. 228. Col. 3.</note> a famous <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Author obſerves, that there was nothing left in the World, but what God took care to give the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſome Laws about; as for Inſtance, If any <hi>Jew</hi> went out to Plow, he was forbidden to do it with an Ox and an Aſs: If to Sow, he was forbidden to Sow his Field with ſeveral kinds of Seed: If to Reap, he was forbidden to Reap the whole Crop: If any one went about to Bake Bread, he was commanded to take of out his Dough, ſo much as to make a Cake thereof to Conſecrate it: If any one did Sacrifice any Animal, he was charged to give away to the Prieſt, the right Shoulder of it, with both the Cheeks and Inwards: When any one found out a Neſt of Birds, he was obliged to let the Old one fly away: If any one went a Hunting, he was to ſhed the Blood of his Game, and then to cover it with Duſt: When any one had planted any Fruit-Trees, he was to count the firſt thereof as Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed for the three firſt years: When any one
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46528:117"/>found a Sepulchre, even there certain Cautions are preſcribed: If any one Shaved himſelf, he was forbidden to <hi>Mar the corners of his Beard:</hi> When any one built a Houſe, he was to take care there ſhould be Rails, and <hi>Mezouzoth</hi> made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all danger: They were obliged to put par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Threads in their Garments, and there are many other things, which were apparently commanded to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jews,</hi> by obliging them to the practice of theſe and ſuch other Laws as took up all their time. But if we may ſay in general, that the whole ſcope of the Ceremonial Law was to employ the <hi>Jews:</hi> We may yet more juſtly ſay, that it was in particular intended by God to inſpire into his people a horrour againſt all Idolatrous practiſes, and an Averſion againſt all Commerce with Idolaters: And this may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcerned, if we examine thoſe Laws in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's this perfectly by the manner of God's pronouncing ſome Meats unclean, and his forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to eat the fleſh of ſome Animals. For we may find, that the greateſt part of theſe Animals were Worſhipped amongſt the Heathens. Thus the more Learned amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> prove, that the Goat and the Ram were of that number, but ſo no doubt were all the Animals which were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offered in Sacrifice to God, as particularly the Bull: Now there is nothing which alienates two Nations from one another more, than when one of them Eats, or Sacrifices, that which the other makes the Object of its Religion.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt Learned Authors that ever the <hi>Jews</hi> had, hath diligently obſerved, that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46528:117"/>God gave many Ceremonial Laws directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe Rites which the <hi>Zabij</hi> uſed in their Superſtitions,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spencer</hi> de Leg. <hi>Moſ.</hi> Lib. 2.</note> and a learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Doctor hath lately proved it very largely; as to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which God commanded to be uſed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Paſchal-Lamb, and in the manner of their building of the Altar, and of their going up to it, in the prohibition of ſeething a Kid in his Mothers Milk, and of offering Honey in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, in the prohibition of their forcing their Children to paſs through the Fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> in the Law which prohibited their eating Blood, and rounding the Corners of their Heads; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Marks in their Fleſh, and in I do not know how many other Laws of that Nature, the deſign of whoſe inſtitution is not ſo evident now ſince the Rites of all thoſe Ancient Idolaters are utterly aboliſhed, and but imperfectly recorded in ſome Ancient Authors.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that we need only make a very little Reflexion upon God's Conduct, in giving all his Laws to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> thereby to judge, that the main ſcope of thoſe Laws, was to put a bar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all other Idolatrous Nations, which ſhould be a viſible, and a conſtant diſtinction, till the Meſſiah ſhould be born, who was to make all thoſe Marks of Diſcrimination to ceaſe entirely.</p>

                        <hi>That God ſeems to have deſigned to keep up a Spirit of Jealouſie in the very Boſom of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE have ſeen in general, that God by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Law to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> intended to diſcriminate them from all other Nations of the World, and in particular from thoſe Nations which had ſhewed themſelves to be jealous of that diſtinction; I mean from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> and the <hi>Edomites,</hi> as I ſhall hereafter ſhew. I have likewiſe obſerved, that God by his Conduct, and his Oracles, did alſo excite a Spirit of Jealouſie amongſt the ſeveral pretenders to the Promiſe. I come now to ſhew that God hath follow'd the ſame deſign in his Law, and that he hath made uſe of that Jealouſie as of another means, to make that People, which he had ſeparated from all other Nations, keep up always amongſt themſelves a lively Notion, and Expectation of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the Reader may think, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections may interrupt the Series of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I have undertaken to make upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: But beſides that I ſhall reſume them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, ſo one may eaſily diſcern, that theſe two Remarks concerning the Spirit of Diſtinction, and the Spirit of Jealouſie, kept up in the Boſom of this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46528:118"/>people, ought to be well conſidered by thoſe that deſire to know the Genius of God's Laws, and the original Cauſes of all the Tranſactions related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the other ſacred Authors, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in purſuance of that Deſign which appears in thoſe Laws which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave to the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I begin with two general Reflexions, which, I think are very uſeful in the explication of God's Conduct upon this Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Two things, as I have already obſerved, have conduced to keep up that Jealouſie, whereof <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> has given ſo many inſtances in the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is, The Preference which God hath commonly given to the younger Brothers before the elder.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, The choice which God hath made of ſuch particular perſons as appeared abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unworthy of God's choice.</p>
                     <p>So that here one ſee's a continual Series in the Jewiſh Hiſtory written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the Prophets, who made the ſame Obſervations upon that <hi>Model</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had given them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, The Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> is preferred before all the other Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly before the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards occaſioned the Inſurrection of ſome <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites</hi> in their Sedition againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> periſhed: Juſt as God's preferring <hi>Abel</hi> offended <hi>Cain,</hi> and as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren conſpired together to put him to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Dreams, which foretold his greatneſs and their fall.</p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:46528:119"/>
                     <p>Secondly, One ſee's that <hi>Phares, Judah</hi>'s young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son, is preferred not only before all the other Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> but even before <hi>Zerah</hi> the eldeſt of the Twins which <hi>Judah</hi> had by <hi>Thamar;</hi> juſt as <hi>Jacob</hi> was preferred before his Brother <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> tho' they were Twins, and <hi>Eſau</hi> born the firſt of the two.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's afterwards, That God having choſen <hi>Jeſſe</hi> of all the Poſterity of <hi>Phares, David</hi> the youngeſt of all his Sons, was preferred before his Brethren, when God was pleaſed to tranſlate the Kingdom to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> Juſt as we ſaw before, that, in the Election of the firſt King, whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſet over them, that he was choſen by Lot by an extraordinary effect of Providence out of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> tho' the youngeſt of all <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Children.</p>
                     <p>Thus one ſee's that <hi>Solomon</hi> the youngeſt of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Children, was preferred before his Brothers, and that the ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple of God in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> tho' he himſelf was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſhall afterwards ſee, That the Meſſiah was deſcended from <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> Son to one of <hi>David</hi>'s younger Children, and by <hi>Reſah Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s youngeſt Son, from whom the Bleſſed Virgin drew her Original.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Remark is about the care God hath taken by his choice of ſome particular perſons to accompliſh the promiſe, to furniſh thoſe with pretences and objections, who might be intereſſed, to oppoſe the Reſtrictions which God had made in favour of their equals; for as they ſerved to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46528:119"/>keep up a Jealouſie amongſt all the pretenders to the Promiſe, ſo they alſo ſerved to preſerve a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge of it, and to make them inquire more diligently after it.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, as we ſee that the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> might up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid <hi>Sarah</hi> both with her frequent Rapes, and with her Cruelty to <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael:</hi> As the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> might upbraid <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity with <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s ſupplanting their Father <hi>Eſau,</hi> and cheating him of his Bleſſing; ſo likewiſe we may obſerve, that God not only choſe <hi>Thamar</hi> to have the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah deſcend from her; but alſo would have her Inceſt with her Father in-Law recorded. What might all the other Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay, were there then no honeſt Women in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the Meſſiah's Anceſtors muſt deſcend from thoſe that were born of an Inceſtuous Commerce? What probability is there, that God ſhould chooſe the Tribe of <hi>Judah?</hi> Had not all the other Children of <hi>Judah</hi> a fairer pretenſion to this priviledge, than <hi>Phares</hi> could have? And might not their Poſterity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive againſt the Poſterity of <hi>Phares,</hi> that ſevere Law againſt Baſtard Children which we read of <hi>Deut.</hi> XXIII.</p>
                     <p>God choſe in the like manner <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> and had her Hiſtory written, and his choice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, as if he had intended to prepare an excuſe for thoſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who afterwards would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit to <hi>David.</hi> What probability is there might they ſay, that God would have the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to be born of a <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> ſeeing it was by his order, that <hi>Moſes</hi> cauſed all thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be put to death, who after the pronunciation of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>'s Propheſie, held any commerce with the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46528:120"/>Daughters of <hi>Moab?</hi> Was there any likelihood that ſuch a thing could be poſſible, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was a Law which God would have to be inſerted in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which excludeth the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites</hi> from the poſſibility of ever being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of God. But at leaſt, was not this choice of <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> a fair cauſe of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to all the other Families of <hi>Judah?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God cauſed the Adultery of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be carefully recorded, as it were on purpoſe to excuſe the Rebellion of thoſe who afterwards ſided with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> againſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> and his Authority.</p>
                     <p>Is it probable, (might theſe Rebels ſay) that God would have choſen that Bloody Cruel Man <hi>David,</hi> that Adulterer, that he and <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> ſhould beget the Meſſiah together?</p>
                     <p>Had <hi>Jeſſe</hi> no other Children beſides <hi>David?</hi> And if <hi>David</hi> muſt needs have been the Man, why ſhould <hi>Solomon</hi> born of <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> be preferred before all his Brothers?</p>
                     <p>There are three things conſiderable in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That God having given to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah,</hi> the conduct of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after he had formerly raiſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo much above his Brethren by his advancement in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and given to his Tribe two portions of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> he permitted, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſhould riſe up againſt <hi>Rehoboam, Solomon</hi>'s Son, and not only ſo, but ſhould likewiſe, according to the Propheſie rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 17. build a Temple at <hi>Bethel,</hi> as being jealous againſt <hi>Solomon,</hi> who built one upon Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> according to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46528:120"/>we find in <hi>Geneſis</hi> XXII. 14.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That this ſeparation, gave a fair pretence to raiſe the Reputation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies which <hi>Jacob</hi> uttered upon his Death-Bed in favour of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> which Propheſies ran in terms ſo very high, that they not only gave colour to <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s pretenſions to the Kingdom, but did alſo lead the Ten Tribes into an expectation, that the Meſſiah ſhould be born, not in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> had expreſly foretold <hi>Geneſis</hi> XLIX. but in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> according to the conſtant Cuſtom of God's preferring the younger Sons of a Family before the Elder, in the matter of this Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That even the greateſt part of the two Loyal Tribes received at laſt the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which the other ten made of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. At leaſt, it appears, that many of the <hi>Jews</hi> have endeavoured to prove, that the Meſſiah ſhould come from the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> by interpreting ſeveral Propheſies that way, which according to their account and their prejudices, were expreſſed in ſuch terms, as could not be underſtood of him, that was to be born in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and out of the Royal Family of <hi>David.</hi>

                        <hi>That Circumciſion was a means of diſtinguiſhing the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>from other Nations.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BUt I muſt now reſume my Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. Circumciſion was, without queſtion, one of the firſt, and moſt ſenſible means whereby God did diſtinguiſh <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity from all other people. I will therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with it,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The very ſignification of the Word Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, implies a real, and corporeal diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<note place="margin">Hiſt. l. I.</note> Even <hi>Tacitus</hi> underſtood it ſo when he ſaith, <hi>Circumcidere genitalia inſtituêre Judaei ut diverſitate noſcantur.</hi> But beſides, by it God's Covenant was, as it were, Printed, and Ingraved in the very Fleſh of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>God has explained it thus himſelf in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and one may affirm, that this was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's deſign, which was, as we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before, to hinder that people, from which the Meſſiah was to be born, from ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the other Nations of the World, which would have made the Pedigree of the Meſſiah ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, or at leaſt much more difficult to be traced.</p>
                     <p>I will not relate here, the ſeveral Notions of Divines about the uſe of that Ceremony, but only content my ſelf to make two very natural Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon it.</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:46528:121"/>
                     <p>The Firſt of which is, That it was particularly in reſpect of the Meſſiah, that God would have that Mark made upon that part of Man's Body which is inſervient to Generation. As the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to come into the World by Generation, according to the words of the firſt Propheſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and alſo according to the further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> about that promiſe, ſo God could do nothing more agreeable to the Idea the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had of the Meſſiah, and of his Birth, than to diſtinguiſh them, by a Relation to that Bleſſed Seed, which he promiſed them; as God deſigned, without all queſtion, by that means to oblige the <hi>Jews</hi> to remember the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Mankind; ſo no doubt, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it to fix their minds upon the conſideration of that favour he had ſhew'd to them, as well as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Earth, that the Deliverer of the World might be born in their Common-wealth, and from one of their Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>The Second Reflexion is, That it was the ſame proſpect of the Meſſiah, which made God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe to death, who ſhould either remain Uncircumciſed themſelves, or leave their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo.</p>
                     <p>Is it not a very ſurprizing thing, that ſo much rigour and ſeverity ſhould be uſed in exacting the Obſervation of a Ceremony, which was merely indifferent in its nature, and had no Moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it ſelf? But hereby it appears the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, that God deſign'd, that the uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, by which he diſtinguiſhed <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity from all other Nations of the World,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46528:122"/>ſhould be a kind of immoveable Bar, to hinder the <hi>Jews</hi> from mingling with all Strangers.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there are three things which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt theſe Reflexions.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That it does not appear, that this Ceremony was counted ſuch a proper ſign of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, ſeeing the uſe of it hath been ſometimes intermitted: As for inſtance, when the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> left it off for forty years in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That if the chiefeſt end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was to diſtinguiſh that people, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make the Meſſiah known: There was no need that that yoak ſhould be laid upon all the <hi>Jews,</hi> but only upon the Family from which he was to deſcend, or at the moſt upon the Tribe wherein that Family was comprized.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That Circumciſion was common both to <hi>Eſau</hi>'s and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity; and even u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Colchis,</hi> as we may learn from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and ſome other Heathen Authors.</p>
                     <p>But after all, it is an eaſie thing to ſatisfie a Man's mind in all theſe appearing difficulties. I confeſs, that one is ſurprized to ſee that God ſhould not oblige the <hi>Jews</hi> to be Circumciſed in the Wilderneſs, for which ſeveral Reaſons are given.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God being diſpleaſed with that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, would not allow, that they ſhould be honoured with this Token of his Covenant; others ſay, that their journying in the Wilderneſs gave them a Diſpenſation from the obſervance of that Ceremony. But we may give a better, I think, and more natural account of that matter, if we
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46528:122"/>do but follow the Idea which occaſioned my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reflexion.</p>
                     <p>The going forth of ſome <hi>Egyptians</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was a Type of the calling of the Gentiles, as I will ſhew ſomewhere elſe: It was then neceſſary, that as all Ceremonies, and Circumciſion in particular, were then to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, to take away all diſtinction from among <hi>Seth</hi>'s Poſterity, ſo the uſe of Circumciſion ſhould at that time be ſuſpended.</p>
                     <p>However, God would not have the Suſpenſion of that Ceremony, to continue till they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, To prevent the intruding of ſome <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> into the Body of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To the end that theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who were to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> being as well Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Children, and being all made afterwards equal by Circumciſion, ſhould have no occaſion to upbraid them with their <hi>different original.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Objection may as eaſily be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: One might think at firſt, that indeed the Meſſiah had been more eaſily known at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, if the uſe of Circumciſion had been injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the Family, or at moſt, to the Tribe from which he was to deſcend: But beſides that, it had expoſed that Family, or that Tribe to great Perſecutions, it had certainly much diminiſhed that Spirit of Jealouſie which was kept up by the Conformity of the ſeveral pretenders, which on the other hand was of mighty uſe to preſerve a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea of the Meſſiah, and a deſire of his coming.</p>
                     <p>As for the Third Objection, there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it: 'Tis true, ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Interpreters
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46528:123"/>imagine, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> took occaſion to preſcribe the uſe of Circumciſion to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> after <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had commanded his people to do what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould bid them to do: But that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is groundleſs: For it appears, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> who went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> were not Circumciſed. 'Tis true, that Nation did ſome Ages after <hi>Moſes,</hi> take up the Ceremony of Circumciſion; and it is very likely, that it was ſome <hi>Egyptian</hi> Colony which introduced the uſe of it into <hi>Colchis:</hi> But the obſervance of that ſole Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony amongſt thoſe Nations could cauſe no confuſion, becauſe none of them pretended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Original from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but had as Hiſtorians obſerve, quite different Reaſons from thoſe which the <hi>Jews</hi> had for their practice of Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> the greateſt part of the <hi>Jews</hi> are of opinion, that God did diſcriminate their Circumciſion from the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which was practiſed by thoſe Nations, by his Inſtitution of what they call the <hi>Perigna</hi> after the Circumciſion; which they endeavour to prove by a paſſage in <hi>Joſhua,</hi> wherein it is ſaid, that God ordered <hi>Joſhua</hi> to Circumciſe again the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the ſecond time. But others of them laugh at that Criticiſm, becauſe it appears that thoſe words do relate to the ſecond ſolemn Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that People did obſerve after their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Therefore, without running to this anſwer, one needs only follow the Idea we have already made uſe of, which is drawn from God's deſign of keeping up a Spirit of Jealouſie, by ſome Conformity betwixt the Circumciſion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46528:123"/>practiſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Ceremonies uſed amongſt thoſe Rival Nations.</p>
                     <p>Why then were ſome of the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Canaan,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed? As for Example, the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> who were Circumciſed at thirteen years of age; the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah, viz.</hi> the <hi>Midianites</hi> who were in the Countrey of <hi>Moab,</hi> and the <hi>Edomites</hi> deſcended from <hi>Eſau,</hi> who did all practiſe Circumciſion?</p>
                     <p>Certainly, It is evident, that as God ſet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the midſt of all thoſe Nations, who by virtue of their Anceſtors Birthright, or ſome other pretenſions, put in their claim with the <hi>Jews</hi> to the execution of the Promiſe, on purpoſe to excite the attention of this people who were ſurrounded with theſe Rivals. So he did for the ſame reaſon permit, that the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> ſhould practiſe the Ceremony of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, almoſt in the ſame manner that the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>But that we may the better apprehend the force of this Reflexion, we need only conſider the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, which is cauſed amongſt the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians, by the Conformity of Sacraments, which is ſo far from uniting them with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it might juſtly be expected; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, one may ſay, that this Conformity in ſome things alienates them from one another, and breeds Reciprocal Jealouſies amongſt their ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſpecially when they come, to reflect upon the other Controverted Articles, that cauſe the Separation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is reaſonable to conſider that God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46528:124"/>had provided a ſufficient diſtinction, betwixt that people, and other Nations, by giving them many other Laws, which had no other viſible uſe than that of <hi>Diſcrimination;</hi> as for Inſtance, the three great Feaſts which the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to keep.</p>
                     <p>The Feaſt of the Paſſover, was the memorial of the accompliſhment of God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> to deliver his Poſterity out of the Countrey wherein they were to be in Bondage after 430 years; and conſequently could not be obſerved by the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> nor by the <hi>Edomites</hi> who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Captives in, nor delivered out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the fourth Generation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was a publick Monument of the Promulgation of the Law, and all its parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequently peculiar to that Nation.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Feaſt of Tabernacles preſerved the memory of that ſolemn action of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance for forty years in the Deſert.</p>
                     <p>It were needleſs, after ſuch remarkable diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to obſerve here, (which yet was certainly deſigned for that end) that God took care to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh that people by ſome Injunctions, which they were to obſerve, in the faſhion of their Cloaths, of their Beard, of their Philacteries, of their Mezouzoth, of their Thaleth, of their Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zith, and many the like things, the obſervance of all which ſerved to hinder any confuſion of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with their Neighbours.</p>

                        <hi>That the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>engaged the</hi> Jews <hi>to the ſtudy of their Genealogies, that they might certainly know that of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BUt if God took care to diſtinguiſh his people from all other Nations by ſuch an indelible Mark, in the practice whereof there was no fear of any trick; ſeeing no Man would Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf without thinking upon it more than once, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Sichemites</hi> aſſures us; ſo one ſees, that he took as great a care to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them into Tribes, and the Tribes into Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that they might ſubſiſt and continue in a kind of a Separation from one another, altho they were at firſt but one ſingle Family, and one ſingle Nation.</p>
                     <p>Now to what purpoſe, I pray, were all thoſe Diſtinctions, if they had not been deſigned, to manifeſt the Meſſiah at his coming.</p>
                     <p>We ſee then, that they could have no other uſe, for as God had decreed, that the Meſſiah ſhould be born out of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the ſeveral Genealogies of that Tribe ſhould be very publickly known.</p>
                     <p>And therefore one ſees that God ſecured this, not only with all neceſſary care, but even with a Caution greater than could have been reaſonably deſired.</p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:46528:125"/>
                     <p>He engages all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to preſerve with a kind of affectation, their ſeveral Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Tables; he neglects none of the means that might be uſeful to diſtinguiſh the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> from other Tribes, and the Family from which the Meſſiah was to be deſcended from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Families of the ſame Tribe.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I am not ignorant that anciently one might ſee ſome other Nations uſing the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Tribes amongſt themſelves, much after the ſame manner as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and that they were careful to preſerve their Genealogies in order to derive their Original from the ſame common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus we ought to underſtand what we read in Hiſtory of the Tribes amongſt the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Thus <hi>Hippocrates</hi> runs up his own Pedigree to the twentieth Man of his Anceſtors, and <hi>Herodotus</hi> mentions ſeveral Inſtances of the ſame care.</p>
                     <p>But one ſees that this affectation was infinitely greater among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For we ſee, that they did not only rank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every one under the Standard of their own Tribe, at their going forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that God did alſo engage every Man to know his Tribe exactly; nay, he compelled them all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſtudy their own Pedigrees, that every one might claim, and reap the benefit of the Law of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> which had the force of an Entail in reſpect of every Family, as I am now going to ſhew.</p>
                     <p>There are three things obſervable in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That it was by a ſuperabundant precaution, that God would engage the Tribes to continue diſtinguiſh'd from one another, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46528:125"/>to preſerve and ſtudy their ſeveral Pedigrees; namely, he intended by that means to prevent the Objection, which might otherwiſe have been made, that it was impoſſible for a Tribe, and a Family in that Tribe to continue diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the Nation, for ſo many Ages; for certainly, if all the Tribes in that Nation, and all the Families in every Tribe, did continue, by God's Providence, ſo long diſtinguiſhed from one another, there is no doubt to be made, but he could preſerve the ſingle Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Family of the Meſſiah diſtinguiſhed from all other Tribes, and Families of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second Remark is, That it was for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake, that the Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were fill'd with Genealogical Tables; to what purpoſe elſe had Books of that importance, and which treated of ſuch great Subjects been filled with Genealogies? <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Books are full of them: The firſt Book of Chronicles reſumes thoſe Genealogies with all poſſible exactneſs: There is nothing more conſiderable in the Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> than the Genealogy of <hi>David</hi> and his Family.</p>
                     <p>The Third Remark is, That if the Genealogy of the Prieſts ſeem to have been better known, than that of other. Families, by reaſon of their being the Publick Miniſters of Religion, which ſeems to give the advantage of certainty of diſtinction to the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> above that of <hi>Judah,</hi> in that particular; yet we find, that all the Families of the whole Nation took much the ſame care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their own Genealogies; ſo that if after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, ſome particular perſons
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46528:126"/>were excluded from the Prieſtly order, to which they pretended, becauſe they could not make out their Pedigree: So likewiſe all were thrown out from the other Tribes, that could not juſtifie their Lineal Deſcent.</p>
                     <p>Nay, there is ſomething further, deſerves to be taken notice of, as being very ſingular in that of <hi>Judah:</hi> and one ought here to conſider a Miſtery of God's Providence, and admire the Wiſdom of his Conduct, in purſuing the deſign which <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt ſets down, and upon which one ſees, that the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State was formed; for when God reſolved, that the Meſſiah ſhould deſcend from the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> he made it more particularly known and diſtinguiſh'd, than any other Family in the whole Nation, and for that reaſon he ſets <hi>David</hi> upon the Throne.</p>
                     <p>Every one knows, that in every Kingdom the Genealogy of a King, and of the Royal Family, is of all others the moſt publickly known.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Blood Royal alone is always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed how much more muſt it be ſo, when that Supream Dignity is conferred upon ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as God had particularly choſen, to have the Meſſiah, who is ſet forth as the deſire of all Nations, to be born out of it.</p>
                     <p>From hence I will boldly conclude, that the only end for which God raiſed <hi>David</hi>'s Family to the Throne, was becauſe the Meſſiah was really to be born out of that Family, reduc'd to a low, and private Condition, which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Iſa. XI.LIII.</note> That <hi>a Rod ſhould come forth out of the Stem of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and a Branch grow out of his Roots;</hi> and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, That <hi>he ſhould grow up as a Root out
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46528:126"/>of a dry ground,</hi> which was very agreeable to the Character of a Prophet, and to the low ſtate of Humiliation, in which our Saviour was to appear in the World.</p>

                     <p>INdeed the diſperſion of the Ten Tribes ſeems to be a very Natural Objection to thoſe who would diſpute the Reflexions which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made upon theſe Genealogies.</p>
                     <p>But after all, there is nothing in it but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the more the ſaid Reflexions.</p>
                     <p>And we may ſay, that the intire diſperſion of the whole Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and of the others which adhered to it in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Rebellion, is a Miſtery of Providence which challenges our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, as much as the raiſing up that Family to the Throne, out of which the Meſſiah was to be born.</p>
                     <p>To apprehend this the better, we need only call to mind the pretenſions of the Tribe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim:</hi> This <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the younger Brother of <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> had given him the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, juſt as <hi>Iſaac</hi> before had given it to <hi>Jacob,</hi> tho it did of right belong to the elder Brother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> had particularly bleſſed <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46528:127"/>made it a Form of Bleſſing for after Ages, as we read in the Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> that there was one made for <hi>Pharez. Jacob</hi> had given to <hi>Joſeph</hi> two Portions in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> had the Birthright before <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> by God's order; it was then very natural for the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as all Tribes did apply to themſelves the ſeveral priviledges promiſed to their reſpective heads, to look upon themſelves, as having a particular right to God's Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>And they thought this right of theirs was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out, as by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dreams, ſo eſpecially by the Words of that Prediction which <hi>Jacob</hi> gave in favour of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the words of which run ſo very high, that after ſuch a prejudice, there might very well be a fair pretence for the hope which the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> had once to ſee a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah come out of their Tribe, as thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected one out of theirs.</p>
                     <p>If to all this we add, That <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was authoriz'd by a Prophetical Inſpiration, and by a ſpecial ſign of God's Approbation; and that on the other hand he deſired to propoſe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the two Calves which he ſet up in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> as Symbols of the Deity, only to purſue the Idea's of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dreams, which <hi>Joſeph</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, the repreſentation whereof, did clearly ſhew both the greatneſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care of God's Providence over him.

                        </note> It was then natural, to the Men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to feed themſelves with ſuch hopes, as the <hi>Jews</hi> teach us they did, when even to this very day they ſpeak of a Meſſiah of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What did God then do, to obviate theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46528:127"/>of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim?</hi> He diſperſed them, together with the other nine Tribes that ſubmitted to the Authority of its Kings, and ſo confounded them with all thoſe Tribes which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their fortune, that tho there ſhould be ſtill ſome <hi>Ephraimites</hi> in the World, yet it would be impoſſible for any of them to juſtifie his Pedigree ſo clearly, as that any Meſſiah really deſcended from that very Tribe, could by eſtabliſhing his Genealogy, put his being of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> beyond all conteſt.</p>
                     <p>Now according to this Notion of things it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (if we may be allowed to enter into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God,) that he did particularly preſerve the Tribes of <hi>Levi,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> with the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which was the only Tribe that was to be preſerved of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> obſerves, there was nothing ever ſaid as to the Meſſiah, of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe God would by that means confound the more effectually all the claims of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in ſhort, If the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by God with the Kingdom over nine Tribes of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo had the Tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> been raiſed up before to the Soveraignty over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> over the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and even that of <hi>Ephraim</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>If the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was deſcended from a younger Brother, to whom <hi>Jacob</hi> had given his Bleſſing in prejudice of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his elder Brother, (which is conſiderable becauſe God hath almoſt conſtantly preferr'd the younger before the elder)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46528:128"/>ſo the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was deſcended from him that was both the younger Brother of <hi>Joſeph</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the youngeſt of all <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Children, notwithſtanding which, the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did freely yield to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the glory of giving Birth to the Meſſiah, was wholly due to them.</p>
                     <p>Be it as it will, there are two Reflexions more which muſt be made concerning theſe Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which appear very natural in this place.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That both St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> do begin their Goſpel with the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>The other is, That ſome time after St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns the ſtudy of Genealogies, which was ſtill much in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as vain; Why therefore is there ſuch a different conduct amongſt the Diſciples of the ſame Maſter?</p>
                     <p>Certainly, whoever ſhall conſider with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the grounds which I have laid down before muſt acknowledge, that both St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ought to have begun their Books, as they have done, with the Genealogy of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt of all, It was neceſſary that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Meſſiah from <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> ſhould be clearly made out: it was requiſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould ſet down ſuch a Genealogy as was known by the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: Now this they have done with very great care, and the thing was ſo eaſie, and ſo well known, that even a Blind-Man of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the chief City of the Kings of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly call <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:46528:128"/>
                     <p>But on the other ſide, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s forbidding the ſtudy of Genealogies, does not at all contradict the method of thoſe two Evangeliſts.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, he purſues the very ſame Notions: He ſaw, that the Converted <hi>Jews</hi> apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſtudy of Genealogies, which was then ſo great a part of the ſtudy of their Nation: It is ſtill practiſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to that degree,
<note place="margin">Maimon. Praef. ad Jad. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaka.</note> that ſince their diſperſion they gave an exact Relation of all the Doctors and Rabbies amongſt them who have preſerved the Tradition, and who were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of Juſtice: What therefore was to be done in this caſe? He took it for granted, that God had engaged every <hi>Jew</hi> to ſtudy his own Pedigree with care, for no other end but only to have that of the Meſſiah diſtinctly known whenever he ſhould come.</p>
                     <p>But the uſe of theſe Genealogies being once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the Meſſiah's coming into the World, he obſerves with reaſon, that it was no longer neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep up the vain ſtudy of all thoſe Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies.</p>
                     <p>So that we ſee he ſpeaks againſt the ſtudy of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees, much upon the ſame grounds as in other places he inveighs againſt Circumciſion; for ſince the chiefeſt uſe of Genealogies, as well as of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, was to diſtinguiſh <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity from the reſt of Mankind, till the Meſſiah was come; the uſe of theſe two Obſervations was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to ceaſe after he was once come.</p>
                     <p>It is, no doubt, for the ſame reaſon, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Apoſtle's time took great care upon all occaſions, to take notice of the Tribe from which they were deſcended, as well as to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46528:129"/>ſet down the Names of their Fathers, yet one ſees that the Apoſtles did not all affect it. And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions his being a <hi>Benjamite:</hi> It was for a particular reaſon, for otherwiſe as he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched down the diſtinction betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo he declared himſelf with the ſame Earneſtneſs againſt the diſtinctions which were obſerved amongſt their Tribes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have expreſſed this truth, when he ſaith <hi>Gen.</hi> XII. that when <hi>Abraham</hi> came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was already in the Land; that is, he had already invaded it, neither can we refer what he relates in the XIV. Chapter, concerning the War which the Kings from the Eaſt came to make againſt the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> to any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>'Twas then for this reaſon, that long before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s time, God took <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> from amongſt <hi>Shem</hi>'s Poſterity to bring him into <hi>Canaan</hi> amongſt the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>God could have placed <hi>Abraham</hi> any where elſe; but he choſe to bring him into a Countrey, which the Poſterity of <hi>Ham</hi> had ſeized upon alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, rather than into a place poſſeſſed by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Japhet,</hi> on purpoſe that the Jealouſie might be the greater betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Countrey into which God had brought him.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs God did not give him at firſt an entire poſſeſſion, but only promiſed him that his Poſterity ſhould enjoy it, and in the mean while inveſted him beforehand, with a Right to it, by the purchaſe of a Field for a Burying place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Wife, himſelf, and his Children were Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; by which means he ſtrongly fixed his own mind, and the hopes of his Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it is evident, that all the glory which <hi>Jacob</hi> found in <hi>Egypt</hi> when he was invited thither
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46528:130"/>by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> did not make him forget the Right which he claimed upon that Land, by virtue of the Sepulchre both of his Father and Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was there. For <hi>Moſes</hi> informs us, that he deſired to be carried thither after his Death, and that he did expreſly require this Duty from <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his other Children, who paid it in ſovery ſolemn a manner, and with a Mourning ſo very great and famous, that the Name of <hi>Abel-Mizraim</hi> continued to that very place, where the <hi>Canaanites</hi> ſaw the Solemnization of that Funeral by the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were attended by great numbers of <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Children ſtill entertained the ſame hope: <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſolemnly engaged his Children to carry his Bones into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> And one may judge, that the other Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were not leſs ſolicitous to require the ſame Office at the hands of their Children,
<note place="margin">

                     <p>And as the carrying the Body of <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> ſufficiently ſhew'd what were the claims of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo the ſame was very evident by their care in keeping themſelves unmixt with the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> all the time they ſojourn'd in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Splendor of <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a natural engagement for them to ſettle themſelves there for ever; beſides, their vaſt encreaſe forced them in a manner to it. For a long time the Miſeries which they endured,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46528:130"/>invited them to ſeek the Alliances of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by Marriages, and to mix themſelves with a people who were their Maſters, and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce hopes which appeared to be ſo very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. They ſeemed to have been warranted by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Example, who had Married an <hi>Egyptian.</hi> However, one never finds that they tried that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. One ſee's on the contrary, that there was little correſpondence between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their Sacred things: For the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſacrificed to God the abomination of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that is, thoſe very things which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's afterwards, by the great number of <hi>Flocks</hi> which they drove along with them at their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they had continued to follow the profeſſion of their Anceſtors, who were She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds, a very odious Employment to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's at laſt, that after the many Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court, that this people followed God's Conduct, and went out of that Countrey, to poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which none of them had ever ſeen, and yet they lookt upon the obtaining it as a Bleſſing they could not miſs of.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral things very remarkable upon that Subject.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That ſome <hi>Egyptians</hi> went out with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to dwell with them in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was done, not only that there might be ſome indiſputable Witneſſes from among the Enemies of God, of the truth, and greatneſs of the Miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> had wrought amongſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46528:131"/>them, which alſo was a preſage of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Faith, by their inſertion into the Body of the <hi>Jews:</hi> but alſo that there might be ſome Witneſſes of the extraordinary affection which the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of their claims to it by virtue of God's promiſe, that he would put them into poſſeſſion of it. For otherwiſe it is not a common thing that a Colony of Slaves ſhould be ſuffer'd to run away, much leſs that they ſhould perſwade their Maſters to forſake their own Countrey, and their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at home, to go and conquer another for them.</p>
                     <p>The Second Remark is, That God made the <hi>Jews</hi> travel for forty years in the Deſerts of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> not only to make them forget any Tyes they might have had to return again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to accuſtom them to depend wholly upon Divine Providence; but alſo to redouble their deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the poſſeſſion of this Land of Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>It was for the ſame reaſon that God forbad them ſo ſtraitly either the mingling with, or the ſetling themſelves amongſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> tho <hi>Moſes</hi> had given an Example by Marrying <hi>Sephora;</hi> or the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> or the <hi>Moabites,</hi> or the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> tho all thoſe Nations were deſcended from <hi>Therah,</hi> their common Father, or from the Patriarchs.</p>
                     <p>In execution of which ſevere prohibition, God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to put all thoſe to the Sword who ſhould make any alliance with thoſe Nations, as we have inſtance of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXIII. after the deſcription of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Propheſies.</p>
                     <p>And it could be for no other end, that he ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46528:131"/>charged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to cut off the <hi>Hivites, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites,</hi> and other Nations of <hi>Canaan</hi> even to the Women and little Children; but in purſuance of his firſt deſign to prevent all mixture, of his People with thoſe Nations, which without that extream rigour would infallibly and inſenſibly have come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that God preſerved the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,</hi> by ratifying that Alliance, which gave leave to thoſe People tho of the Poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> to continue amongſt his own people in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but tho God did in effect preſerve the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he forced them to undergo the Drudgery, and Servile Offices of the Tabernacle, and that they might be kept, as unqueſtionable Witneſſes of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of their miraculous Conqueſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for the continuance of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart of the Countrey, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the drudgery of carrying Wood, and Water for the uſe of the Tabernacle, tho they were at firſt of another Religion, was, as I have obſerved already, a continual Subject of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Poſterity both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> themſelves.</p>

                     <head type="sub"> 
                        <hi>That the Law tied the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and by ſeveral other means eſtabliſhed the diſtinction betwixt Tribes and Families amongſt them.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ONe may ſay, that one of the moſt effectual means which God uſed to fix his people to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the Law which he gave them to meer thrice a year, and Celebrate three Solemn Feaſts together, which hardly gave them leave to travel far into other Countreys, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them every time they met, to renewin the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts of their Religion the memory and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's of their hopes: And they conduced to this Deſign of God in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Feaſts were Celebrated at three times which were the moſt commodious Seaſons of the year for Travelling, betwixt the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>October:</hi> The Celebration of the Paſſover was upon the fourteenth day after the appearance of the Moon in <hi>March:</hi> The Pentecoſt was fifty days after, and the Feaſt of the Tabernacles laſted from the firſt to the tenth day of <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Law which obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the Celebration of thoſe Feaſts, required the appearance of all the Males of Twenty years of age and upwards, ſo very rigorouſly, that there
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46528:132"/>was no Diſpenſation; for all (without exception) were then obliged to appear. So that even during the Diſperſions of their Nation, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Judea,</hi> aſſiſted always at the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe three Feaſts with great care.</p>
                     <p>This was a viſible way of keeping the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſtinct, by giving each of them a ſeparate portion in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by fixing them inſeparably to it; as the whole Nation was in like manner diſtinguiſhed, by its being placed in a Countrey entirely by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>We ſee accordingly, that God hath obſerved that Method, by giving a Law which injoyns the Diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be made into as many Portions as there were Tribes, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Levites,</hi> as being the publick Miniſters of their Religion, were diſperſed amongſt the other Tribes, that they might more conveniently attend to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the people.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not here take notice of the Miracle which was evident in that Diviſion, which was an exact accompliſhment of the Oracle which <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> uttered a little before their Deaths.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall obſerve, Firſt, That as the deſign of God was to divide that people into Tribes, that the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> from which the Meſſiah was to be born, might be the better diſtinguiſh'd and known, ſo he would, for the ſame reaſon, allot the Cave of <hi>Machpelah,</hi> the Sepulchre of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, to the ſhare of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as alſo <hi>Ephratah,</hi> the place where <hi>Rachel</hi> was Buried, which was afterwards call'd <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the Town where <hi>David</hi> had his Birth, and which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46528:133"/>told by the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> under the Name of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phratah,</hi> as the place where the Meſſiah ſhould be born in the fulneſs of time.</p>
                     <p>We muſt beſides, take notice of two particular Regulations, by which God fixed his people in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and preſerved a diſtinct Idea of this firſt diviſion of that Countrey.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is the Law of <hi>Jubilee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second is the Law of Lineal Retreats.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, by the Law of the Jubilee which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned every fifty years, and by which every one that could juſtifie his Pedigree, was reinſtated in the poſſeſſions of his Anceſtors: God obliged that people to keep up a diſtinct-knowledge of the firſt diviſion made under <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joſhua XIV, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> and which is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in that Book which contains his Hiſtory, much more effectually than if he had made a Law for that very purpoſe: So that tho the Field of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah</hi> had been never ſo often alienated, yet it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways returned to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into <hi>David</hi>'s Family, becauſe it was at firſt the Lot of his Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>This Law of Jubilee preſerved a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſeveral Tribes, and Families, and it alſo kept up a diſtinct Idea of their Genealogies, which muſt be preſerved entire of neceſſity, that they might maintain their right to the inheritance of their Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>It would be to no purpoſe to object againſt this Obſervation, that it was impoſſible to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly which Tribe, and much leſs which Family every Eſtate did belong to, becauſe one ſee's that the firſt Proſelytes who went out with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſhared the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> together with them;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46528:133"/>for one ſee's on the contrary,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God would not allow any of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> to become Proſelytes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tenth Generation.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, That he debarred the <hi>Edomites</hi> from being admitted to make profeſſion of Judaiſm before the third Generation, which excluded them for ever from any poſſeſſions in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Thirdly, one ought to obſerve the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Proſelyte, and a Native <hi>Jew:</hi> The Quality of a Proſelyte, gave permiſſion to an <hi>Egyptian</hi> to live amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to profeſs their Religion, but it gave him no right to poſſeſs any of their Land.</p>
                     <p>And then beſides that,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maſſa Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</hi> c. 1. S. 4</note> thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Proſelites had a particular way of praying by themſelves, different from that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill teſtifie. They could not poſſeſs any Eſtate in Land amongſt them: This is ſo true,
<note place="margin">Numb. XXVII.</note> that it was once round neceſſary to make a particular regulation for the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> that they might have their diviſion, which was granted only under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions, becauſe the Land was not to be divided, but amongſt the Males of the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is very conſiderable, that by this Law of the Jubilee, God fixed the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by giving the Children a power to look upon themſelves, not only as the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heirs of their Parents, but to conſider their Parents only as <hi>Uſu-fructuary</hi>'s, ſince all their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in Land were ſo Entailed, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or right Heirs of any Man could not miſs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46528:134"/>of the Reverſion, becauſe whatever alienation was made, it could laſt but for a time to the year of Jubilee which reſtored all the alienated poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, abſolutely and entirely to the right Heirs.</p>
                     <p>Now that this Law was always lookt upon as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Leviticus XXV. 23. 1 Kings XXI.</note> appears clearly from the words in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and from the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Naboth,</hi> which holy Man rather choſe to die than to comply with the injuſt deſire of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who would have forced <hi>Naboth</hi> to ſell his Eſtate abſolutely notwithſtanding God's expreſs prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
                     <p>The exemplary vengeance which God took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Murder, and the relation of it record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture is a further confirmation of this ſame truth: If a King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> durſt not at firſt infringe that Law, if it was not violated by any other than <hi>Jeſabel,</hi> who was a Forreign Princeſs: If the Tranſgreſſion of that Law was puniſh'd in ſuch an exemplary manner, who can doubt but that it was particularly obſerved in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as a Fundamental Law by which God tied up his People inſeparably to this very Countrey.</p>
                     <p>One needs only make ſome few Reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words which God makes uſe of <hi>Ezek.</hi> XLVI. to agree to what I ſay, if thoſe Reflexions which I have made already upon <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be alſo added to them.</p>
                     <p>One may obſerve upon the ſame Subject, that tho God had ſeveral times ſubjected the <hi>Jews</hi> to a Foreign power, yet he never ſuffered the whole Nation to be all carried away out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> at one time; nor yet to continue in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46528:134"/>for the time of two whole Jubilees; they were but ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was the furtheſt place that they were ever carried into.</p>
                     <p>From whence we may naturally conclude, that their Genealogies could not be confounded in ſo ſhort a time, becauſe many that were at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the ſecond Temple had ſeen the firſt, nor could the diſtinct knowledge of the ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of their Eſtates be obliterated; becauſe thoſe of every Tribe who continued ſtill in the Land, might viſibly keep them up.</p>
                     <p>And we here of neceſſity ought to obſerve in the firſt place, what we may read in the XXXII. Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jerem. XXXII.</note> concerning the ſale of a Field which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> bought.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, what we read <hi>Nehem.</hi> the Vth where he is troubled to ſee the alienation of their Fields, which was a conſequence of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                     <p>And Thirdly, The manner how that people were reſtored to their Eſtates, according to the Fundamental Laws of their State.</p>
                     <p>Another very effectual means to fix that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to preſerve their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies there certainly without confuſion, was the Law of Lineal Retreats, which God inſtituted for this very purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>For in ſhort, when this Rule was once laid down, that upon the failure of an Heir in any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that the next Kinſman was the Heir at Law, it appears plainly, that every one was obliged for his own intereſt, to inquire with diligence into the Genealogical Lives of his own Tribe, that he might inſtruct himſelf in the ſtate of the ſeveral
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46528:135"/>Families of his kindred, and of the ſeveral degrees of Proximity of Blood, whereby they might be related, becauſe the exact knowledge of theſe Liſts, and of thoſe ſeveral degrees of Kindred were abſolutely neceſſary to make uſe of this Right of Lineal Retreats.</p>
                     <p>There were two other Laws which contributed alſo to this; one whereof regulated all that was to be done, when there were none but Daughters left in a Family: A famous inſtance of which, we have in the Hiſtory of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi> ſet down twice by <hi>Moſes</hi> on purpoſe no doubt, that it ſhould be the more taken notice of, as I intend to ſhew particularly in another place.</p>
                     <p>The other Law regulated all that the next Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of any one that died Childleſs, was obliged to do in reſpect of the Relict, and of the Eſtate of the Deceaſed, if he intended to redeem it. One finds in the Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> an illuſtrious Example of the Execution of this Law, which may be found <hi>Deuter.</hi> XXV.</p>
                     <p>Now after all this, let any one judge, whether there could be any ſtronger Ties than theſe to oblige the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to continue in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and whither the diviſion which God made of it, betwixt their ſeveral Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, was not an infallible means to diſtinguiſh them certainly one from another.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
                     <head type="sub"> 
                        <hi>That the Laws which</hi> Moſes <hi>made concerning the ſtate of Virginity, did principally relate alſo to the</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>which holds alſo as to ſeveral other Laws.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HItherto I have ſhew'd the care which God took to diſtinguiſh his people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all other Nations of the World, and I afterwards ſhew'd what care he took to keep the diſtinctions which he firſt ſet up amongſt the Tribes. And I afterwards explained thoſe Laws which he gave to oblige every Family in each Tribe to remain diſtinct. And I afterwards made it manifeſt, that the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to execute this deſign of God.</p>
                     <p>All which ſhews, that God intended to make it eaſie for every Man to diſtinguiſh the Meſſiah, when it ſhould be once known that he was to be born out of the Family of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> as it was afterwards foretold by ſeveral expreſs Oracles.</p>
                     <p>But as there ought to be ſomething ſupernatural in the Birth of the Meſſiah, who was to be born of a Virgin, ſo we ought to ſee what care God took in his Laws, that the Birth of the Meſſiah, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this very Article, might not be a Fact too difficult to be acknowledged and eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>In the Firſt Promiſe which God made to Man in theſe words, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman, ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> being joyned with <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46528:136"/>Propheſie, <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall Conceive,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſ.</hi> VII. It is viſible, that for the accompliſhment of theſe Oracles, one ought to ſuppoſe, that the Meſſiah muſt be born of a Virgin, as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans profeſs to believe: Why ſhould God otherwiſe have taken care, to inſinuate from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, that the Meſſiah was to be born of the ſeed of a Woman, without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of a Man, if he had not ſuppoſed, that he ſhould be born, without the Operation of a Man? And why ſhould <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propoſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of a Virgin, as an Effect wholly Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural?</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, God did therefore by his Laws not only ſecure the State of Virginity, that this thing might not be ambiguous when it ſhould be accompliſhed, but (as we ſhall ſee here) he has by theſe Laws made it extreamly Illuſtrious.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Beſides that, God would have the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Death inflicted upon them that were at any time found guilty of ſins againſt nature,
<note place="margin">Exod. XXII. Deut. XXII. Levit. XVIII. Levit. XX. Deut. XXIII. 17.</note> as alſo upon them, that ſhould be proved to have had any inceſtuous Commerce with thoſe that were nearly related to them, and to whom either the nearneſs of Blood, or of Affinity, gave them a more free, and familiar acceſs. He moreover, ſtraitly commanded, that all Proſtitutes ſhould be put to death without any mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is not only contented to forbid Fornication and Adultery in general, by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to death,
<note place="margin">Exod. XXII. Levit. XX. Deut. XXII.</note> thoſe that expreſly ſhould be convicted of it, and by awarding the ſame Sentence againſt him that ſhould happen to corrupt a Contracted Virgin, and the Virgin her ſelf. But he alſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46528:136"/>Men by two ways from falling into ſins of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, he permitted, on the one hand, a Divorce where the Wife did not pleaſe her Husband, and on the other hand he allowed of Polygamy. This Toleration made that Virgins on the one ſide, not remaining too long Unmarried were not apt to be eaſily corrupted, and on the other ſide Men were not very forward to debauch thoſe Women whom they did not intend to Marry, or to keep when Married, for he that was compelled to Marry a Virgin whom he had ſeduced,
<note place="margin">Deut. XXII.</note> was expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to put her away for ever after.</p>
                     <p>It is natural to obſerve the deſign of thoſe Laws amongſt the people of the <hi>Jews.</hi> In ſhort,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maſſec. Avoth.</hi> c. 5.</note> the deſire of Iſſue made them Marry very young; moſt of the Men were Married at eighteen years of Age.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all Virgins thought it a ſhame to be unmarried; therefore God makes them ſpeak in the third of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in that manner, when ſeven Women would marry one Man, without asking any thing for Diet, or Cloaths, provided only that he would take away that reproach of living without having Children. 'Twas this deſire of Poſterity, which made the Women look upon bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs as a Curſe.</p>
                     <p>Again, this vehement deſire of Children made Eunuchs to be regarded,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lucian de Evnuch,</hi> p. 537. <hi>Lucian de Dea Syriâ.</hi> p. 1069.</note> as Men particularly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of God, not only by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo by the Heathens themſelves: Altho afterwards they paſſed for Holy Men, becauſe they deſigned to imitate what (as they were told) had happened to <hi>Noah,</hi> by his Son <hi>Ham,</hi> which introduced the Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> of Caſtrating
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46528:137"/>themſelves, that they might be Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Deut. XXII.</note> God commanded, that any Virgin which was Betrothed to a Husband, and was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in her Father's Houſe, or that was Raviſhed without calling for help, ſhould be puniſhed with Death; ſo that all the Virgins were indiſpenſably engaged for fear of loſing both Life and Honour together, to preſerve their Virginity with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care.</p>
                     <p>But here is a fourth Law concerning this matter, whereby God obliged the Parents of all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Virgins to take a more than ordinary care of them, when he commands <hi>Deut.</hi> XXII. 21. <hi>That a Virgin for whom the Tokens of Virginity were not found, ſhould be brought out to the door of her Father's Houſe, and there be ſtoned to death, by the Men of the City,</hi> for ſo her Parents were by that means, made partakers of the puniſhment of her Crime, and their negligence, was ſeverely puniſh'd by ſuch a ſhameful Execution as diſhonoured their whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God ſubmitted Women to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Husbands to whom they were Married: Nay, one would think that he intended to raiſe the Jealouſie of Husbands, when he gives them leave to bring their Wives to a publick Tryal, and to puniſh them with Death, when they did not preſerve the Tokens of their Virginity.</p>
                     <p>It was for that reaſon that he commanded, that the Parents or near Relations of the young Married Women thus complained of,
<note place="margin">Deut. XXII.</note> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upon all ſuch occaſions the Tokens of the Virginity of thoſe Daughters which they diſpoſed in Marriage, which was uſually done with many
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46528:137"/>Solemn Circumſtances and Formalities.</p>
                     <p>And here are three things, which deſerve to be attentively conſidered.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is the Cuſtom that was amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for Parents never to let their Virgin Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go out of their Houſes, which Cuſtom made them be called <hi>Concealed,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe that went abroad; that is, that were Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                     <p>The Second is another Cuſtom which the juſt deſire of preſerving the Virginity of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt all Accidents, had introduced amongſt that People, which was, that all their Virgins did wear a ſort of Fetters, which are called in the <hi>Talmud, Cevalim,</hi> which are diſcribed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Maimon,</hi> in this manner: <hi>Cevalim ſunt compedes in forma periſcelidis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad Maſſec. Sabbath.</hi> c. 6. J 4.</note> 
                        <hi>inter quos interpoſuerunt catenulas, illis compedibus ornabant ſe Virgines, ut non incederent paſſu magno, ne contige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret ipſis damnum in Virginitate ſua.</hi> This Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be thought to be one of the fooliſh phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> if we did not meet with proofs of the practice of that Cuſtom in more ancient times. In ſhort, one ſee's in the third of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that Chains are reckon'd up amongſt other Ornaments of the Daughters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which God threatneth to take away from them, when he would force them to go Captives into <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third is an ancient Tradition mentioned in the <hi>Pirke Eliezer</hi> in the XVI. Chapter, <hi>Solent Iſraelitae digito educere Virginitatem, ne incidant in dubitationem vel ſuſpicionem, juxta illud,</hi> Sumat Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; Mater puellae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word, it ſeems, that for fear leaſt theſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46528:138"/>of Virginity ſhould be thought to be obſcure and ambiguous by their Husbands, that God has provided for the ſecuring of the Virginity of their young Women before Marriage by a Miracle, the experience whereof was ordinary and common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo jealous a people.
<note place="margin">Numb. V. <hi>Joſeph.</hi> l. 3. <hi>Antiq.</hi> p. 95.</note> I mean, the Waters of Jealouſie, which all Women whoſe Carriage was ſuſpected by their Husbands, were obliged to drink, by which God did either miraculouſly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, or elſe he began to inflict a puniſhment upon them, which was ſo much the more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exemplary, as it proceeded from the hand of God himſelf. This Miracle laſted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſecond Temple, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves tells us in that Title of their <hi>Talmud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sota</hi> c. 9.</note> which concerns Women ſuſpected of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
                     <p>However, as God works no Miracles without great reaſons, ſo he here made a Law, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance whereof was very rigorous, which was, that he would not ſuffer any Women to be Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when there was the leaſt probability, that they had their Courſes, but that they ſhould be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that time, as unclean.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of this Law was, becauſe it was then almoſt impoſſible, but that the lewd Women might have impoſed upon their Husbands, in the Marks of their Virginity, which at that time are very uncertain; not to ſay, that as a politick Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, he might preſcribe the obſervation of this Law, leaſt the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have been overſtocked with weak, and ſickly people.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, one ſee's that God himſelf has faſtned
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46528:138"/>a Blot upon Leprous perſons,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſidor. Pelus</hi> l. 5. Ep. 117. <hi>Joſeph. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq</hi> l. 3 p. 94.</note> becauſe they were ſuppoſed to have been Conceived when their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their Courſes: And hereupon was that Law of God founded, which debarred Lepers for ever from the Right of coming into the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his people.</p>
                     <p>One ought to make the ſame Obſervation upon thoſe that were unlawfully begotten, for they were deprived of the Right of entring into the Congregation, and how innocent ſoever they were, as to the lewdneſs of thoſe who gave them their Lives; yet they were thus with them made partakers of the puniſhment of their ſin.</p>
                     <p>If one conſiders all theſe ſeveral Laws attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one ſhall find on the one hand, that ſeveral of them were of very little moment, except we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God intended to ſecure the ſtate of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity by them beyond all danger: And on the other hand, one ſhall find that ſome of them are very ſevere about things, which do not ſeem to deſerve ſo terrible a rigour.</p>
                     <p>But if we conſider them according to God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as he hath afterwards particularly explained it. They will appear, I am confident, to be all very worthy of the Wiſdom of ſuch a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</p>
                     <p>One needs only reflect upon that method of God, that I have now explained to ſee, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be conceived to be better managed, than this Model according to the deſign which God himſelf had drawn.</p>
                     <p>One may make the ſame Obſervations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſame ſtroaks of the Wiſdom of God, in ſeveral other precautions, which he made uſe of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46528:139"/>to make the Meſſiah be perfectly diſtinguiſh'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral Characters under which he was to be propoſed afterwards by the Miniſtry of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>One ſees, that the Meſſiah being to be born of a Virgin, was to be a firſt-born, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we find many Laws which diſtinguiſh in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the priviledges of the firſt-born.</p>
                     <p>So it appears by the XVIII of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that the Meſſiah was to be a Prophet; and therefore, God afterwards gave notice by the Prophets of all thoſe Lights which ſhould particularly appear in him. In proſpect of this, God gave by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſuch Characters as would diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the true Prophets from thoſe who endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to uſurp that Name.</p>
                     <p>It appears alſo, that becauſe God was to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Meſſiah, a power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (which <hi>Moſes</hi> intimates, by ſaying, that he was to be a Prophet like unto him.) Therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpecifies the Character of thoſe Miracles in XXXV. Chapter of his Propheſie, and God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in particular, the Laws concerning the Blind and the Lame, and for the ſame Reaſon, he gives an account of all ſorts of Leproſie, that it might be diſtinctly known which was incurable.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to thoſe who will attend to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſee that they were ſubſervient to this deſign of God, in purſuance of thoſe Proſpects which we have already ſet down.</p>

                     <head type="sub"> 
                        <hi>That it was the deſign of God by all theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and particularly by that Veneration which he inſpired the</hi> Jews <hi>with, for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to preſerve the Ideas of the Meſſiah, whom he had promiſed, in their minds, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing them from all other Nations.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AFter all thoſe Obſervations which I have made upon the ſeveral Laws that God made uſe of to execute his deſign of fixing his people to a certain place, and there to keep them ſeparate; it is natural to judge, that the Ceremonial Laws which he gave them for the regulating their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip, were alſo intended for the ſame end. This I muſt ſhew in reſpect of the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God aſcribes to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in reſpect of the whole Service of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, of its Miſterious Conſtruction in all its parts: And in reſpect alſo of the raiſing of the Material Temple afterwards, to be as it were the Center of their whole Religion.</p>
                     <p>It was certainly for this purpoſe, that he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Conſecrated ſeveral things to himſelf, as the firſt fruits, and the firſt-born, and that he ſet apart certain times, as the firſt day of the Month, and certain Solemn Feaſts, beſides the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which was Celebrated long before. And he alſo Conſecrated ſeveral places, as the Towns of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46528:140"/>refuge; and yet more particularly, the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the Temple: But it was eſpecially for that reaſon, that he had Conſecrated certain Rites and Ceremonies, certain Sacrifices, both of Animate and Inanimate things, and certain Offerings of Gold, and Silver, Perfumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's, that he rejected any firſt fruits that did not grow in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> One ſee's, that tho ſome Sacrifices were common to the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Neighbours, yet he diſtinguiſh'd them by ſo many Circumſtances, that they were much different from the others: Thus he forbids them to make uſe of Statues before which other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons uſed to Sacrifice at that time, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to Sacrifice upon high places, where the Heathens uſed to make their Offerings very early in the Morning, at Sun-riſe, which gave riſe to their Worſhip of the Riſing Sun.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing more diſcovers the deſign of God, than the Laws by which he fixed their Worſhip, firſt to the Tabernacle, and afterwards to the Temple, at the places where God did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly reſide. One may ſay, that it was for that reaſon, God commanded the repreſentations of Angels, and of his Law, and of the Manna to be preſerved there, all which beſides, that they were Memorials of the Ancient Apparitions, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God to that people, they were expreſs fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of God's Glory, of his Will, and of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power; he added alſo a Candleſtick with ſeven Branches, a Table covered with Loaves, and an Altar of Incenſe, which were figures of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Planets of this viſible World, of the Bleſſings which we enjoy by Nature, and of thoſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46528:140"/>which we owe unto God for all theſe: He commanded alſo, that none ſhould offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, in any other place except the Temple.</p>
                     <p>He would not permit that any but thoſe who were purified according to the Law ſhould enter into it, he excluded all Uncircumciſed perſons for ever, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had formerly been commanded to pull off his Shooes in the Deſert, at his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the burning Buſh, ſo every one that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Temple was to enter barefoot, as a mark of that reſpect which had formerly been exacted of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what other reaſon but that, could oblige him to give both at the Conſecration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and afterwards ſo many ſenſible Marks of his preſence; that Cloud which was called his Glory reſted there. The <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> which was an Oracle for that whole Nation, was there; there was a daily Sacrifice offered up for the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there were celebrated the three Solemn Feaſts of the Paſſover, of Pentecoſt, and of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he forbid them to Sacrifice any where elſe, and he gave frequent, and illuſtrious Oracles at that place.</p>
                     <p>One ought alſo to obſerve, that after his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (to which all the glory of the Tabernacle was tranſmitted) was fixed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ordered it to be ſuch a ſenſible mark of his preſence, that when we read the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s March in the Deſart, we find, that the Tabernacle was the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Temple, and built after its Model; ſo that as the Tabernacle ſtood always in the midſt of the Tents of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> in the midſt of the whole Camp of all the Tribes of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46528:141"/>
                        <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were all liſted under their proper Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards: So one ſee's afterwards, that the Temple, the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the people of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, according to their different degrees of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they were to approach to the moſt Holy place, which was the Habitation of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, one may ſay, that the building up of a Tabernacle, or of a Temple, ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the nature of Religion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, God who is a Spirit, will be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit, and in Truth: So that this ſeems to have been quitted for a time, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the building of a Tabernacle.</p>
                     <p>But really there was nothing more agreeable to the deſign which God had formed at firſt, as to that people; he intended to make it viſible, and it appears, that nothing could be more effectual to make it ſo, than the double neceſſity to which that whole People was reduced to, to meet in a Body ſeveral times every year in the ſame place, and to offer all their Sacrifices in the Tabernacle, and to be there perpetually employed in the Ceremonial Service, which did inſeparably draw them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fix them there.</p>
                     <p>The end of all thoſe viſible Aſſemblies, was to perpetuate the knowledge of the principal Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Religion, and eſpecially to renew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, the hopes of that people, as to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, who was promiſed to them from God.</p>
                     <p>For God having ſhortned the long Lifes which Men commonly enjoy'd in the beginning, before they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that five or ſix perſons could no longer preſerve the Tradition of 2000
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46528:141"/>years, as they had done till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, God was of neceſſity obliged to make uſe of ſome other means to ſupply that defect.</p>
                     <p>He had already made uſe of ſeveral before, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, was that which we find preſcribed <hi>Deut.</hi> XXVII. where he ordered the building of an Altar with rough ſtones, whereupon the Names of the twelve Tribes, and the whole Law were to be ingraved.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards follow'd other Methods, and thus we ſee, that <hi>Samuel</hi> following <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi>'s Example, repeats before a Solemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people met at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of <hi>Saul,</hi> the things that came to paſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Government of <hi>Bedan</hi> or <hi>Sampſon,</hi> of <hi>Jepthah</hi> and his own.</p>
                     <p>But yet the beſt way was to fix this people to one Tabernacle, wherein we ſee that beſides the Monuments which preſerved the Memory of the great Miracles that God had wrought at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-wealth, as the Pot of Manna, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod that bloſſom'd, the Plates of the Altar that had been made out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and their Confederates.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's, that the Law, and the Books of the Covenant were depoſited there by God's order, and the principal Tranſactions and Deliverances that were wrought by God in the behalf of that people, were continually Celebrated with Hymns and other Tokens of publick Thankfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>It was, no doubt, upon this account, that he cauſed the Book of the Law to be laid up there, with many Ceremonies and Expiations; and that he enjoyned it to be read publickly in the preſence
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46528:142"/>of the whole Congregation every ſeven years. One ſee's, that he commanded, that every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould read this Book continually, and that all ſhould entertain their Wives and Children from their tendereſt years, with the deſign of the Law, Night, and Day, in the Countrey, and in the Town, at all times, and in all places.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's, that God engaged them to it not only by an expreſs command, but alſo by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſity, becauſe he made it death for any Man to violate any of thoſe Ceremonial Laws, from a principle of obſtinacy, no pardon could be obtained for the Tranſgreſſions commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through ignorance, before they were expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by certain Sacrifices, the Forms whereof were ſcrupulouſly preſcribed in the Law, and which could be violated upon no account whatever.</p>
                     <p>If one conſiders thoſe things, he may ſay, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſcarce one moment free in their Lives, ſo preſſing was the neceſſity which lay upon them to conſult the Law of God, the regulations of which were ſo very exact and particular, that there, no actions publick, or private, could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but what were regulated, and determined by thoſe Conſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>If a Beaſt was born, the Owner was to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it was the firſt-born, or no, whither it was clean, or unclean, and whither it was to be Redeemed, with ſeveral other things of this nature.</p>
                     <p>If a Woman was big with Child, there were many queſtions to be asked: When ſhe came to Lie-in, ſeveral very different Ceremonies were practis'd, according as the Child was a firſt-born,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46528:142"/>or not. The Law enjoyned various Purifications according as the Woman brought forth, a Son or a Daughter.</p>
                     <p>God had preſcribed a great number of Laws for all the Accidents of Life, for Marriages, for Succeſſions, for Funerals, for Mourning, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Accidents, as the Death of a Man that was kill'd without the deſign of his Murtherer, for the ſeveral Crimes that might be committed, in their ſeveral Pollutions, and Sequeſtrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeems, that this whole people, from the time that they came, to the uſe of their reaſon, to the time of their Death, was ſtill continually obliged to keep up a Correſpondence with the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> whom God had for this purpoſe diſperſed amongſt all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to conſult the Law and the Teſtimony to be inſtructed in the manner of governing themſelves: But particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were to look upon the Temple and the Tabernacle, as the Center of their whole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And how could they do this, without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their Proſpect at the ſame time to thoſe great Promiſes of the Meſſiah, of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Depoſitaries: I ſay, upon thoſe Promiſes, which raiſed up ſo many Jealouſies betwixt their Forefathers, and the Anceſtors of thoſe Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, with whom they had always ſome Controverſie, and were to be conſidered as glorious and honourable to the whole Nation.</p>

                     <p>For in the Firſt place, the firſt Promiſe of the Meſſiah, was expreſs'd in very general Terms, which mentioned a common benefit to all the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> This Promiſe was made before God had rejected <hi>Cain</hi>'s Poſterity, by preferring that of <hi>Seth;</hi> it was made before the Reſtriction was made to <hi>Noah</hi> in <hi>Seth</hi>'s Family, and to <hi>Shem</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family.</p>

                     <p>As this was a Capital Truth, ſo God propoſed it by <hi>Balaam,</hi> at the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> entring into <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might thus underſtand, that all thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, which their ſeparation living in <hi>Canaan</hi> from the reſt of the World, might keep up, were not always to laſt.</p>
                     <p>But this particularly appears out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which allows of ſeveral ſorts of Proſelytes, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome without tying them to the obſervance of all the Ceremonies in the Law, which it would never have done, if it had been abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be a <hi>Jew</hi> before they have a ſhare in the benefits of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It ſuppoſes, that God was to remove that People out of <hi>Canaan</hi> into remote Countreys, and to diſperſe them, as it were, into the uttermoſt parts of the World, which was done by Divine Providence, only to publiſh the Promiſe of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46528:144"/>Meſſiah, to eſtabliſh the Belief in the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo to facilitate the calling of the Gentiles to the Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He declares expreſly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that he was to call his people, that which was not his people, that he might by that means provoke the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Jealouſie. This Notion of Jealouſie mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be taken notice of with very great care, if we reflect upon the Spirit of Jealouſie, which reigned amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall take notice in another place of the great number of Oracles of <hi>David</hi> upon the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, altho he otherwiſe inſults upon the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> upon all occaſions, and ſhews as much Averſion, and Jealouſie againſt thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as was poſſible for one that lived in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual War with thoſe people.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall alſo make ſome Reflexions upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Marriage with the Princeſſes of <hi>Tyre,</hi> of <hi>Sidon,</hi> and of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that is to ſay, with the Poſterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> which was united to that of <hi>Judah,</hi> to take a part with them in the Bleſſing; from whence it came to paſs, that the Song that was written upon that Marriage, was preſerved as a piece divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ought to be conſidered, as a happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the calling of the Gentiles to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>One may alſo joyn here the manner of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s giving to <hi>Hiram</hi>'s Subjects, who had helped him in the building of the Temple, the Countrey of <hi>Chabul,</hi> which was incloſed within <hi>Judea,</hi> altho thoſe people were of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> Poſterity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46528:144"/>whom <hi>Noah</hi> had particularly pronounced,
<note place="margin">Gen. IX.</note> 
                        <hi>Curſed be Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One may alſo ſee, that as God had permitted his people to be Tranſported into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and had raiſed up there Prophets amongſt them on purpoſe to acquaint the World with the glorious hopes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo he cauſed the Books of Scripture to be Tranſlated into Greek about 300 years before our Saviour's Birth, not only to prevent all ſuſpicion of falſhood in the minds of the Gentiles, if they were produced of a ſuddain after the Birth of the Meſſiah, but alſo to inſtruct the Heathens by little and little of the Right which all Nations had as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; that they might take their ſhare in it when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould be invited to it by God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to take away the Scandal which was to follow upon God's deſtroying the Form of that Commonwealth by the <hi>Romans,</hi> according to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Prediction.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things, no doubt, engaged the <hi>Jews</hi> who read the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> to make particular Remarks upon them.</p>
                     <p>But they ought to have obſerved three things eſpecially: The Firſt was, That altho God had at firſt choſen their whole Nation, yet he was pleaſed to diſperſe afterwards almoſt ten parts of thirteen; which plainly ſhew'd, that this choice which he had made, was only an Oeconomical choice, and for a particular deſign.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That altho he was very ſevere and punctual in exacting obedience to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Service, yet he had fixed the moſt part of their obſervances to certain places, to certain
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46528:145"/>times, and to certain perſons: It was eaſie to judge, that when God bounded them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it was only for an Oeconomical Service pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed only upon a particular proſpect, which was one day to have an end.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That experience convinced them that altho God ſeemed to have fixed his Service to the Temple, yet he ſuffered the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the firſt, and did not reſtore to the ſecond, the firſt Marks of his preſence, when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built by the order of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From whence it was natural to conclude, that ſuch a glory as retired by little and little from that place which God had choſen, was only deſign'd to be there for a time, till God ſhould extend his Service, by calling all the World to his Religion, and ſo making the whole Univerſe his Temple, as we ſee it done in our days, by the calling of the Gentiles to the Religion of our Saviour.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IN my Reflexions upon the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> I have ſhewed the means God made uſe of to imprint the Idea's of the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, during that long Tract of <hi>2500</hi> years, before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and before the Hiſtory of it was penn'd by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that conſider that God at firſt preſcribed the Law of the Sabbath, to fix the belief of the Creation of the World, and that this Law hath been conſtantly obſerved ſince the beginning of the World, until <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is ſtill to this day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> eaſily apprehend, that this Fact of the Creation, could not be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtably proved, or more firmly grounded.</p>
                  <p>In like manner an attentive Reflexion upon the Oracles which I have mention'd, and which alone at first were the foundation and hope of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:46528:147"/>of the Patriarchs, and were afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> is ſufficient to perſwade any one, that it was impoſſible, but the memory of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, ſhould be deeply engraven in the minds of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe, that the Spirit of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, which God had raiſed amongſt the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pretenders to the execution of that great Promiſe, did not much contribute to preſerve the remembrance of it; as I have ſhown very carefully, that it was very uſeful for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>I have in my Reflexions afterwards proved upon the four last Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that God proſecuted the ſame deſign in the Laws which he gave to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as in the peculiar Forms and Regulations of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Religion; the great deſign of which Rules, was only that the Meſſiah at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World, might be unqueſtionably known.</p>
                  <p>Whoever ſhall read the Reflexions which I have made upon this matter, will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the long Life of the Patriarchs, was of great efficacy, to make ſo freſh and lively an impreſſion of thoſe illuſtrious Facts, the Creation of the World, and the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, that there was no need of very frequent Oracles to confirm the ſame, as indeed we find that in
<pb facs="tcp:46528:147"/>the ſpace of <hi>2553</hi> years, only five or ſix prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Oracles were given, which have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relation to the Meſſiah, as I ſhall ſhew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Now this Reflexion being once ſuppoſed, as the Life of Man was afterwards conſiderably ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo one may judge, that this Promiſe ought to be more frequently propoſed, and more clearly explained. And we ought to ſuppoſe that in proportion to the delaying of the Promiſe, and the ſhortneſs of Mens Lives which diſcouraged their hopes of ever ſeeing a Promiſe fulfilled, which their Anceſtors whoſe Lives were much longer, could never attain to the more diſtinct knowledge which God gave of this great object, was in order to ſtir up ſtrong deſires in the minds of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom God was afterwards to renew the Ideas of it: and conſequently we find, that a greater number of Oracles and Propheſies, were required from time to time, to entertain and ſtrengthen the belief of a Promiſe, the accompliſhment whereof was ſo conſiderably deferred.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, this was exactly the Method which God followed, the Spirit of Propheſie having in a moſt illuſtrious manner been employ'd to preſerve the Idea's of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, and to increaſe them in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> until the time of the accompliſhment it ſelf; and God hath
<pb facs="tcp:46528:148"/>ſo exactly ſet down by the Prophets, the ſeveral parts of his deſign, as there needs not be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any difficulty in diſcerning the proſecution of that deſign which he had formed at firſt.</p>
                  <p>I intend in this Third part of my Reflexions on the Writings of the Old Teſtament to explain this Method which God hath followed, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he hath accommodated himſelf to the state of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he had made the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitaries of his Oracles, and proportioned them to their underſtanding and deſires.</p>
                  <p>For the more happy execution of this Deſign, and a clearer diſcovery of this Conduct of God, which ſeems ſomewhat obſcured, by intermixing theſe Predictions concerning the Meſſiah, with a great number of Events, during that Series of Ages, whereof we have the History written by his own order: I think my ſelf obliged first of all to explain the Reaſons why God was pleaſed to interweave the Oracles which relate to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, with other Matters, that ſeem to be of a very different nature; and then ſhall lay down the Rules which one ought to follow in applying the ancient Propheſies to the Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>After theſe Preliminary Reflexions I ſuppoſe, that in order to a fuller diſcovery of the Series of God's deſign and a more diſtinct knowledge of the Progreſs of the Revelation of this Matter, that I ought again to reſume, and to ſet before the
<pb facs="tcp:46528:148"/>Eyes of the Reader, the five or ſix principal Oracles which God hath given concerning the Meſſiah, from the beginning of the World to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> together with that Oracle which he uttered by the mouth of that illuſtrious Legiſlator.</p>
                  <p>One will eaſily judge without my undertaking to prove it, that the Idea's of theſe Oracles were familiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> until <hi>David,</hi> during the ſpace of <hi>400</hi> years, after which God began to diſcover the ſame more particularly, in chooſing <hi>David</hi> to be the Perſon, in whoſe Family that Prophecy ſhould be accompliſhed, becauſe the Meſſiah was to be born of his Seed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I ſhall immediately paſs on to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe Oracles which <hi>David</hi> himſelf uttered on this Subject, which deſerve ſo much the more attention, becauſe God, who at that time changed the Government of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did conſiderably augment the Idea's which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had concerning the Promiſe of the Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I ſhall collect under certain Heads thoſe Oracles which were uttered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets concerning the Meſſiah, ſome hundred of years before the Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and ſoon after; and foraſmuch as the Light concerning this matter was at that time much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the Oracles themſelves are much more clear and diſtinct, as giving many more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Characters of the Meſſiah, ſo I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="tcp:46528:149"/>my ſelf briefly to touch upon them, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal Characters which they give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>After which I ſhall have nothing elſe to do, but to make ſome Reflexions upon the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the time of the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, until that wherein the Chriſtians pretend that this Promiſe and theſe Oracles were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the perſon of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the multiplicity of the things which I am to handle, and which I intend to do with the greatneſs briefneſs that is poſſible, might ſeem to oblige me to omit the examining the ſucceſſion of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet God having been pleaſed to intermix the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many other Tranſactions, with theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it obligeth me in this third part to make alſo ſome Reflexions upon the Historical Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> And indeed, this will be of great uſe to prove the truth of theſe Oracles, and the manner how God hath conſtantly followed that Draught, which he at firſt form'd to himſelf; as alſo to make it appear, that notwithſtanding the different Revolutions of the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, he hath always continued thoſe Means, which he choſe at firſt, to facilitate the diſtinct knowledge of the Meſſiah, whenever he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>It is very neceſſary to explain this Series of the
<pb facs="tcp:46528:149"/>Deſign of God, to make the Authority of theſe Prophecies more firm and unmoveable; thoſe Laws, the obſervation of which ſerved to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Family of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, being ſo many Boundaries and Limits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which God was pleaſed to confine himſelf, that his Conduct in this matter might be the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſervable and known.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as in my Reflexions upon the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I have begun by the firm eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Truth of thoſe Books, on which I made my Reflexions, without which that Work would have wanted all its ſtrength; ſo I intend alſo in this part to follow the ſame Rule, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I ſhall at firſt eſtabliſh the Truth of the Hiſtorical and Prophetical Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> for if one ought to prove that theſe Prophecies were well known and very famous, then it will be expected from me that I ſhould ſolidly demonſtrate the Truth of thoſe Books in which thoſe Oracles are recorded, before I can of right conclude that the Facts which are related by other Authors, are the accompliſhment of theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>This deſign would naturally engage me to prove the Truth of every one of theſe Books in order particularly; but as I have not only proved the Truth of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> already, but that moreover I intend in my reflexions on the Books
<pb facs="tcp:46528:150"/>of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to demonſtrate the Truth of them beyond all conteſt; and beſides, that the Hiſtorical and Prophetical Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are ſo eſſentially linked with thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Diſciples of Jeſus Christ, that it is impoſſible to acknowledge the Truth of the one, without owning at the ſame time the Truth of the others, I believe I may be diſpenſed with, as to the proving the Truth of every Book of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in particular; And therefore becauſe I intend to be very ſhort, I will confine my ſelf to ſome general Reflexions upon thoſe Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which were writ ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſuch, as I hope, will be ſufficient to ſatisfie an equitable and intelligent Reader.</p>

                     <p>THE firſt general Proof which I make uſe of to eſtabliſh the Truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Books of the Old Teſtament, after <hi>Moſes,</hi> may be lawfully drawn from the uninterrupted Series of Events, which are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46528:154"/>related by thoſe Authors who have written the Hiſtory of the State and Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may obſerve ſeveral conſiderable <hi>Epocha's</hi> of this Hiſtory, which takes in about One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and forty years.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part takes in all that happened after <hi>Moſes</hi> 'till the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom, which is related in the Books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Ruth,</hi> and the Firſt Book of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond contains the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 'till the Deſtruction of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third contains an Account of what paſſed during the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Captivity, and after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment.</p>
                     <p>Now there is not one of theſe Books which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Hiſtory of this People, in one or other of theſe <hi>Epocha's,</hi> which has not certain Characters of the truth of its Relations, by the neceſſary Connexion which it has either with thoſe Events which went before it, or with thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd it, and this by a natural and immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. This ought to be confirm'd by ſome Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> which contains the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is the Execution of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s deſign, who brought the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to go and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of a Countrey, which the <hi>Jews</hi> pretend that God promiſed to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Diviſion of this Land amongſt the Tribes, is the Title which each Tribe had to its Poſſeſſions in it; and this Diviſion ſubſiſted a great while very diſtinct, and well known by the ſeveral Tribes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46528:154"/>this People, There happened no conſiderable Change, but only when the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Ten Tribes into Captivity, after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the Three thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty third year of the World: The Country continuing in the ſame ſtate, under the two remaining Tribes, without any Change en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing upon their Tranſportation into <hi>Babylon,</hi> as I have obſerved in the Nineteenth Chapter of my Reflexions upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the following Books.</p>
                     <p>This Book has a very natural Influence upon the following Books, as is manifeſt from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Alliance which the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> got from the <hi>Jews</hi> by ſurprize. It ſerves for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to all that happened for Four hundred and thirty years after, in <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, under whom the Commonwealth, being already changed into a Monarchical Government, had in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance undergone a great Alteration.</p>
                     <p>The Book of <hi>Judges</hi> has an eſſential Relation to the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the moſt part of the Captivities of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being a Conſequence of their Quarrels with the Nations which they had ſubdued, or with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> deſcended from <hi>Lot,</hi> who were. jealous of this People that was deſcended from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There we may ſee, for Inſtance, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon the Defenſive part, becauſe God forbad them to ſet upon the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> whereas theſe laſt pretended that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had uſurped ſome part of their Country.</p>

But we may find the Memory of ſome of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by thoſe publick Hymns which were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the Nation, and by theſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Monuments of their Judicial Authority, which were preſerved amongſt them, and which kept up a Remembrance of them amongſt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and the Neighbour Nations.</p>
                     <p>For this ought to be obſerved with care, That ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> could not invent any thing upon this Head, which would not be well known by all the Neighbouring Nations, as the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> who kept up their own Government 'till <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time, who ſubdued them intirely, and the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> whoſe Empire continued for Fourteen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after <hi>Lot</hi>'s time, until the Deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> it was not eaſie for any fabulous Relations in this matter, to obtain Authority.</p>
                     <p>The Book of <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſeems not to have any thing conſiderable, but the Converſion of <hi>Ruth</hi> a <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> who rely'd upon the hopes of the Houſe of <hi>Juda,</hi> out of which ſhe had marry'd her Husband. But we may take notice of three things beſides; 1. Of the exact Practiſe of that Law which obliged them to marry the Widow of a Relation who dy'd without Iſſue. 2. Of their lively remembrance of the Deeds of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as of <hi>Juda</hi>'s Inceſt with <hi>Thamar,</hi> which was look'd upon however, as a fountain, and a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Bleſſings. 3. Of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46528:156"/>whom this Author repreſents as deriving his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from a <hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> which not making much for the Honour of a King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> do's at the ſame time confirm the Truth of the Relations which are contained in that Book.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> contains the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Eli</hi>'s and <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Judicatures, of the change of the Government from a Commonwealth to a Monarchy under <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s Anoynting, <hi>Saul</hi>'s Rejection and Death.</p>
                     <p>The Second contains the Hiſtory of <hi>David,</hi> his Victories, his deſign of building a Temple, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which God left to <hi>Solomon</hi> to execute, his Wars with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> his Crime with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhebah,</hi> his Son <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Inſurrection againſt him, and his great Succeſſes againſt his Enemies. There is nothing in theſe two Books, which has not an exact Connexion with what went before, and what follows. One ſee's throughout, an exact Relation to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> One ſee's through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, Monuments ſet up in ſeveral Places, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memory of particular Actions; One ſee's alſo in the Wars of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with their Neighbours, a conſtant Series of thoſe old Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which were the Fruits of the Jealouſie of theſe Nations againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Books of the <hi>Kings,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon but as one Book, contain an Abridgment of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Eſtabliſhment in the Place of <hi>David,</hi> of the Glory of his Empire, which was carried by <hi>David</hi> to the Banks of <hi>Eüphrates,</hi> according to the ancient Prophecyes, of his Marriage with the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Daughter, of the Building of the Temple, and his own Palace, with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46528:157"/>help of <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre;</hi> One ſee's the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>'s viſit to <hi>Solomon,</hi> of his Alliances with the <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> and the <hi>Hittites;</hi> thinking by theſe Marriages to have put an end to the old Quarrels between his People, and theſe Nations, who were jealous of the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> All this was done in the Forty years of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s Reign; and as there never was ſo famous a Reign in <hi>Judea,</hi> ſo never was there any, of which there are left ſo many Monuments, as well there, as in the Neighbouring Countreys.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's afterwards in the ſame Book, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Empire into two Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that of <hi>Juda,</hi> which continued from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Death, during the Reign of Eighteen Succeſſors, for Three hundred eighty ſix years, to the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchaanezzar;</hi> and that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> form'd by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Two hundred fifty four years, under the Reign of Nineteen Succeſſors, until the taking of <hi>Samaria</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about Twenty ſix years after that of the <hi>Kings,</hi> carries the Hiſtory down to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Founder of the Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who gave the <hi>Jews</hi> their Liberty again. The Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> contain the Hiſtory of what paſſed under his Succeſſors, to the time of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for almoſt Eighty two years.</p>
                     <p>It was in this Interval that the Deliverance happened which the <hi>Jews</hi> received under <hi>Esther,</hi> Wife to one of the moſt powerful Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46528:157"/>the Memory of which the <hi>Jews</hi> celebrate every year in all places, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth days of the Month <hi>Adar,</hi> (which anſwers to our <hi>February</hi>) by virtue of <hi>Esther</hi>'s Law.</p>
                     <p>After theſe general Remarks with which I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent, I ought to make ſome Reflexions, which cannot be omitted without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away a great deal of force from thoſe Proofs which eſtabliſh the Truth of this Matter.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That as theſe Hiſtories have a neceſſary Relation to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo they could not have been neglected by a People, who in their Religious and Civil Conduct, were abſolutely regulated by thoſe very Laws.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That all the Actions related in this Hiſtory, have paſſed altogether in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of a People, the Extent of whoſe Country is not Twenty Leagues in breadth, nor Eighty in length.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, That this People having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Law of the Seventh year, and of the Firſt year, or Year of Jubilee, (which Law you have in the Twenty fifth of <hi>Leviticus</hi>) from their firſt Conqueſt and Diviſion of the Country, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven years after their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Obſervation has ſerv'd for a double Cycle, to fix the remembrance of thoſe Actions, and to make it paſs from one Generation to another. And ſo, the greatneſs of that Promiſe which God made to <hi>Hezekiah, Eſai.</hi> XXXVII. 30. and II <hi>Kings</hi> XIX. 29.) may eaſily be underſtood; that altho' <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi>'s Invaſion would in all probability lay waſte all <hi>Judea,</hi> yet they might eat the Fruits of the Earth in quietneſs, the Fourteenth year of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46528:158"/>and the next year they ſhould eat the Fruits that would grow up of themſelves without Tillage, and that on the Sixteenth year they ſhould have liberty to till the Ground, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which ſhews, without any force upon the words, that the Fifteenth year of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign, was the Sabbathical year, in which the <hi>Jews</hi> were forbidden to Cultivate the Ground.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is, That it appears in effect by the Series of this whole Story, that things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo, as to agree with the publick Records which were extant amongſt the People: This is manifeſt, if we conſider how often the Sacred Penmen refer us to the Hiſtories and Annals of thoſe Kings of whom they ſpeak, and of whom they only quote the principal Stories in ſhort in purſuing their Deſign, which was intirely to bring an Account of the ſtate of the Religion and the Government of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> under one view.</p>
                     <p>Let us go on to other Proofs to eſtabliſh this Truth.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That there is a ſtrict Connexion between the Sacred Hiſtory, and the oldeſt Monuments which we have of Prophane Hiſtory.</head>
                     <p>AS there was but few very Ancient Writers of Prophane Hiſtory, and as we have but ſmall Fragments of them diſperſed here and there,

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46528:161"/>thoſe which were written by and after <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jewiſh Hiſtorian obſerves; ſo we cannot compare the Jewiſh and Pagan Hiſtories together afterwards, in that form we have done hitherto.</p>
                     <p>But it is eaſie to obſerve four things, which are very conſiderable, upon this Head.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That the Credit of the Sacred Hiſtorians may be grounded upon the great number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks we have made already, or elſe nothing will ever eſtabliſh it. For how can we conceive that all ſorts of Hiſtorians, of all Nations and all Ages, <hi>Babylonians, Aſſyrians, Tyrians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> could agree ſo exactly with the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe Facts they relate, if the Jewiſh Authors had not exactly follow'd the Rules of Truth?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That as the Prophecies of <hi>Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribe, with an almoſt incredible exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the conſiderable Events which happened in the Countries near to <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Judea</hi> it ſelf, in a time which was not expired until the Sacred Writers had given over writing amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo there was need of almoſt nothing elſe, but to look over the Books of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to ſee what happened from day to day. And here we may obſerve, That the Reaſon why <hi>Porphyry</hi> thought the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> was forged after the time of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> was becauſe this Book ſeem'd to him to be rather a Hiſtory than a Prediction, which he juſtify'd in making a ſort of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon this Prophecy, by comparing with it the Pagan Hiſtorians which were then extant.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That as the Jewiſh Commonwealth came under the Power of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46528:161"/>of Learning, and of the Art of writing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, ſo there is little need of any other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes beſide the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, in effect, by proving that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were well enough acquainted with the Affairs of the Jewiſh Nation.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That we do really find after the time of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> a very great part of the Jewiſh Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compoſed by the care of ſome particular Men, with ſufficient exactneſs, tho' it be not of equal Authority with the Sacred Writers.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That there is an uninterrupted Series of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents foretold by the Sacred Oracles, of which we may ſee a very great number accompliſhed in every Age.</head>
                     <p>AS we may very reaſonably ſay, That all the Hiſtory of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> has a very exact dependence upon the Writings of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Legiſlator; ſo we may alſo obſerve, That there are ſcarce any conſiderable Events which make up the Body of this Hiſtory, which do not deſerve a particular Remark, either as a fulfilling of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prophecies, or of thoſe other Prophets whom God raiſed up after him to reform the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that Nation. And it is a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, That in all the Series of Events fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, there was not one Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46528:162"/>amongſt all the Offſpring of the People, but what ſaw the Accompliſhment of ſeveral of theſe Oracles. A little attention and care in comparing the Chronology of the Oracles with that of the Events, will ſufficiently juſtifie what I ſay. I ſhall content my ſelf with obſerving their different Orders, which will ſatisfie a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, ſince my Deſign do's not engage me neceſſarily to do a thing which would carry me too far, and which may be done with little Application.</p>
                     <p>We may conſider four ſorts of Oracles; 1. Thoſe which have reſpect to particular Facts nigh at hand. 2. Thoſe which have reſpect to particular Facts, but at a greater diſtance. 3. Thoſe which have reſpect to Facts which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the whole Jewiſh Nation. 4. Thoſe which have reſpect to Facts which belong to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations, either bordering upon <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> or further from it.

                     <p>You have a Prediction of the Advancement of <hi>Jehu</hi> in the place of <hi>Jehoram</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>You have the Prediction of <hi>Jehoiakim</hi>'s Death made by <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> XXII. 18, 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXVI. 30. which happened Ten years after.</p>

                     <p>It is therefore fully evident, That the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particular Facts, which were to happen in a very ſhort time, ſerved to eſtabliſh the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prophets. And in effect one ſee's that they proceeded upon the Authority which thoſe Predictions of nearer Events gave them, to foretell other particular Events at a greater diſtance.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold after a ſort, after <hi>Jacob,</hi> the manner how the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was to be divided, tho' the thing was to be done by Lot.</p>

                     <p>So that it is plain, That the foretelling of theſe particular Facts, which were at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, revived the Memory of theſe Prophets amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in every Age, and made them read them with a ſingular attention.</p>
                     <p>One ought alſo to make the ſame Reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Oracles which have reſpect to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Events of the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and its Continuance until the time of the Meſſiah, after which the Prophets foretel its Ruin and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without Remedy.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, one may ſay, That there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution never ſo little conſiderable, of which we do not find very many, and very particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, foretold by ſeveral Prophets upon very different Occaſions, and particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. That there are no Books in the World which are formed like thoſe which we find in the hands of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One finds there a Hiſtory exactly purſued, and in a natural dependance, from the beginning of the World, for 3500 years.</p>
                     <p>One finds there a Series of Oracles which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel all ſorts of Events, ſo inſeparably united with the Hiſtory, that it is impoſſible to find by what means the Prophecies could have been ſo brought to ſupport the Hiſtory, and the Hiſtory to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Authority of the Prophecies.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46528:165"/>
                     <p>One finds Oracles ſo clear, and ſo particular, eſpecially in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> That <hi>Porphyry</hi> a mortal Enemy to the Chriſtians, was forc'd to aſſert that the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> was forged after <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>'s time; a ridiculous Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! For this Prophecy was tranſlated into <hi>Greek</hi> more than One hundred years before, and was in the hands, not only of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> alſo, mortal Enemies to the whole Jewiſh Nation.</p>
                     <p>This alſo is very ſurprizing, That ſince the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their Diſperſion, preſerve theſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wherever they are, as the Accompliſhments of the Oracles, and theſe Oracles as Predictions of thoſe Events of which their Hiſtory is very full, they ſhould never think of propoſing to us any Books of a like Nature, conſidering that now for One and twenty Ages they have had no para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Authors, who have both writ Hiſtory, and pronounced Oracles.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But, as theſe Reflexions lead us on to others, ſo we ought to enter upon them by conſidering what the moſt unreaſonable Obſtinacy can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the Authority of the Hiſtorical and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Books of Scripture.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                     <head type="sub">That how common ſoever Oracles may have been amongſt the Pagans, yet nothing amongſt them can juſtly be compared with thoſe which are found amongſt the Jews.</head>
                     <p>ONe of the greateſt Objections which can in all probability be made againſt this ſurprizing Series of Oracles, which are found in the Books of the Old Teſtament, is taken from that great number of Oracles which are found amongſt the Pagans. This Objection deſerves to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it will more clearly demonſtrate the Authority of the Prophetical Books, which are in the hands of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confeſs there have been falſe Prophets: And indeed, ſince God has given us Marks to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from true Ones, which may be ſeen in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it cannot be denied but there have been ſome falſe Prophets. And that moreover, the Hiſtory of the Prophets diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us Impoſtors frequently, we may freely acknowledge, that amongſt the Pagans, and the People bordering upon <hi>Judea,</hi> there have been Men who have boaſted of Predictions of things to come, as well as amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confeſs alſo, That ſome Heathen Writers ſpeak of certain Oracles, which in all appearance are very well circumſtantiated, and of which they relate a very exact Accompliſhment.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46528:166"/>
                     <p>But ſeveral things ought to be obſerved upon this Argument, which deſerve an attentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. We ſee that their moſt celebrated things have been only an imitation of what was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> imitated the <hi>Urim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi> of the Jewiſh High Prieſt. And they appropriated to him the right of giving Oracles: And ſo we ſee they are given by a Voice from Heaven, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw was granted to their Prophets. We may ſee it in the Hiſtory of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Life, and in <hi>Apuleius, p.</hi> 339.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. We ſee that the ſame Pagan Hiſtorians take notice that very many, even the greateſt part of their Oracles, were very ambiguous, and falſe. The Philoſophers, and <hi>Tully</hi> particularly, openly laugh'd at them (<hi>Lib.</hi> I. II. <hi>de Divinatione.</hi>) They thought it a ridiculous thing that <hi>Apollo Delphicus,</hi> the God of Poetry, ſhould give his Anſwers in very bad Verſe, and at laſt be reduced to Proſe. <hi>Euſebius</hi> quotes a Diſcourſe of <hi>Oenomaus</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſopher, who wrote againſt Oracles, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry them as Impoſtures.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. We ſee, that thoſe Oracles which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the greateſt Reputation by their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, were borrowed from the Prophets of the Synagogues. We have an illuſtrious Example in the Birth of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had foretold, about the Year of the World 3292. and concerning which they pretend to ſhew Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Craeſus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Abydenus. Herodot.</hi> Lib. I. cap. 55. &amp; 91.</note> about the Year 3492. which ſhows that if the thing was really known to them, they could not have known it but by the Prophetical Writings which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46528:167"/>the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which could not have been concealed from them, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> read them with care, to comfort themſelves under that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to which they were reduced by <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It is in effect proved by examining their Oracles, moſt of which were either falſe or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This <hi>Euſebius</hi> has clearly proved, [<hi>de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. Evangelicâ, Lib.</hi> IX. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.] The Proverb of the <hi>Sibyll</hi>'s, or <hi>Delphick</hi> Prieſteſs's, favouring of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> is commonly known. It was eaſie for theſe Heathen Princes to biaſs their People with ſuch Predictions.
<note place="margin">Lib. IV. <hi>de Praeparat. Evangel.</hi> Lib. IV. ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiò.</note> But what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays, puts the thing beyond all Queſtion, for he expreſly ſhews, That when the Prieſts were put to the Rack, they confeſſed the whole contrivance of thoſe Oracles, which they pronounced to abuſe the Credulity of the People.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. We ought to obſerve, That we cannot find great numbers of Oracles upon the ſame Subject, whereas one ſee's that the Prophets follow'd (as it were) <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Model of the State of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that they frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in foretelling the ſame Facts from one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to another.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. We ought to remember that theſe Oracles were not kept within the Limits of one ſingle State or Nation.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. It may be ſaid that they were not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, having been only propoſed in private places, before a very few, and in ſhort, that they were not actually known to the moſt part of the Neighbouring People; whereas one ſee's that the Jewiſh Prophets gave their Oracles in the moſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46528:167"/>ſolemn Aſſemblies, and when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Writing, they were known to all thoſe who had any Commerce with that Nation. So that <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecies were queſtionleſs known to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who look'd upon himſelf as deſigned by God to reſtore their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the <hi>Jews.</hi> We may make the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which was known to <hi>Alexander</hi> without all queſtion, as one may collect from the favourable Reception the <hi>Jews</hi> found from him.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. We ought to obſerve, That theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Oracles were given, for the moſt part, in favour of thoſe Princes, who could ſatisfie the greedineſs of the Prieſts. Whereas the Prophets among the <hi>Jews</hi> lived in the moſt diſ-intereſted manner in the World, and uſually pronounced nothing but Reproaches and Menaces of cruel Calamities to thoſe Princes who had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Hands. Their Miniſtry conſiſted in a couragious oppoſition to the Corruptions in their Laws, and their Religion, and in cenſuring their Princes and Governours with a ſingular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity; and indeed, we ſee that moſt of them met with the puniſhment of their Boldneſs, and made trial of the moſt cruel Tortures.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. Laſt of all, We ought to take notice, that as the Oracles which are mentioned in Heathen Authors, were only of Facts of ſmall importance to thoſe People, amongſt whom it is ſaid that they were pronounced, ſo we do not find that they thought themſelves much concerned in their preſervation; whereas one ſee's that the Jewiſh Nation were ſo perſwaded of the Truth of theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46528:168"/>Oracles, with which they were entruſted, that nothing to this very day could ever oblige them to diſcontinue the reading of them, whatever Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes they may otherwiſe have with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who make uſe of them to eſtabliſh their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, notwithſtanding <hi>all the Claims</hi> of the Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>When this is laid down, it would ſeem as if I might reaſonably conclude, That the wonderful variety of Oracles which are to be found amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> cannot be at all weakned by thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of which we find ſo frequent mention in Pagan Writers.</p>
                     <p>But we ought to go further, in explaining two things, which will perfectly clear this matter; One is, That the Hiſtorical and Prophetical Books of the Old Teſtament, after <hi>Moſes,</hi> can be no Forgeries: The other is, That in truth, thoſe Oracles which we find inſerted in thoſe Books, could not poſſibly have been forged after their Completion.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the Books, in which we may find theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, were never forged.</head>
                     <p>I Have obſerved formerly, That it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Authority of thoſe Books, in which theſe Oracles are inſerted, be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we can build upon the Authority of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46528:168"/>the Oracles. And indeed, if we cannot clearly ſhew that theſe Books were written, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, before the Things happened, which are ſaid to be Accompliſhments of thoſe preceding Oracles, it would be natural to call in queſtion the Authority of theſe Oracles. But it is very eaſie to ſatisfie an equitable Reader herein, and to eſtabliſh in general, or ſeverally, the Exiſtence of theſe Prophetical Writings, before the times in which thoſe Facts happened which we propoſe as the Accompliſhment of thoſe Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall make uſe of two ſorts of Reflexions to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh my Propoſition. The Firſt conſiſts in general Conſiderations upon the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The Second has reſpect to particular Facts, which are unconteſted, and whence the ſame Truth very naturally reſults.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. We ought to obſerve, That whereas in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis Moſes</hi> makes uſe of no other <hi>Epocha</hi> to fix the time of any Event, but the years of the Life of ſome famous Patriarch: As for Inſtance, He fixes the Flood to the 600 year of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Age;

This was a Character to fix the time of all thoſe who lived after that <hi>Epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Building of the Temple began a new <hi>Epocha</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears from II <hi>Chron.</hi> VIII. 1. tho' they began after that time to reckon by the years of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46528:169"/>
                        <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as appears by the Books of the firſt Prophets. Which is a Character ſufficiently certain, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh thoſe who liv'd after <hi>Solomon,</hi> with the time when they liv'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It's plain, That the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, and afterwards their ſubjection to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, obliged them to fix their Events, and to date their Prophecies, by the years of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe Foreign Kings. [See <hi>Daniel, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Haggai.</hi>] So the Author of the Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> refers to the years of the <hi>Seleucidae.</hi> Now, that we may the better perceive the force of this Obſervation, we muſt remember three things. 1. That the Authors who lived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the carrying away of the <hi>Jews</hi> into <hi>Babylon,</hi> make uſe of ſome <hi>Chaldee</hi> Terms, which are not to be found in the foregoing Prophets. For we may ſee in the Books of <hi>Haggai,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. XL. 1. Daniel X. Zach I. Hagg. I.</note> 
                        <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> the ſame ſtyle with <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> 2. The Authors of theſe Books, give names to the Months, which they had not before the Captivity. The <hi>Jews</hi> only called their Months,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Talm. Roſch. Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanah.</hi> c. 1.</note> Firſt, and Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo they gave Names which were unheard of before. 3. The Authors of theſe Prophecies take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any newly inſtituted Faſts; thus we ſee that the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> mentioned thoſe Faſts of which we have nothing in the Law, but which were inſtituted during the Captivity.</p>
                     <p>We muſt blind our ſelves of purpoſe, to conceive that any Impoſtor could forge Books, which have ſo exact a Relation, and ſuch certain Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticks to fix them to the time in which every Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor lived, and to the Circumſtances wherein he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46528:169"/>wrote. We muſt of neceſſity grant, That before ſuch an Impoſtor could bring about ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he muſt have made himſelf Maſter of the whole Prophane Hiſtory, to fix ſo exactly the Hiſtory of the Jewiſh Nation, and of thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which have been given in Circumſtances which are unintelligible without the help of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hiſtories of different Nations.</p>
                     <p>I come now to Facts which cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted. It is ſufficient that thoſe Facts be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as true, to eſtabliſh in general the Truth of thoſe Books whereof we teach.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It cannot be denied, that the <hi>Jews</hi> preſerve theſe Oracles to this day, with great fidelity.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It cannot be denied, that they are in the hands of Chriſtians, who preſerve them as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince they have been ſeparated from them; that is, for almoſt Seventeen Ages.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It cannot be denied, that theſe Prophecies have been exactly read by the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of thoſe Oracles upon which they believe, to this day, that the whole happineſs of their Nation is founded.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It cannot be denied, that the <hi>Jews</hi> have read theſe Books exactly to refute the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who have pretended from the firſt Age of their appearing, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah mark'd out by theſe Oracles. In ſhort, whereas the Chriſtians pretend to prove by the accompliſhment of the ancient Oracles, that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſiah: It is known, that the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to this day to wreſt the ſenſe of theſe Oracles, and to ſhew that there are many things which are not literally accompliſhed, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46528:170"/>which by conſequence cannot be apply'd to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. It cannot be deny'd, that moſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of the <hi>Jews</hi> with the Chriſtians, only regard the Application of the Text of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Authors. The Chriſtians explain them in a Myſtical Senſe, the <hi>Jews</hi> maintain that they ought to be explained Literally.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. It cannot be deny'd, that about 300 years before the Birth of our Saviour, the Prophetical Books were tranſlated, and put into the Hands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> having been carried to, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by a publick Order of the whole Nation, for the ſatisfaction of a King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Hiſtory of that Verſion which put thoſe Sacred Books into the Hands of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thing in the World, and which made thoſe Books perfectly known.</p>
                     <p>Here we have now theſe Books in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and in <hi>Greek,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Vulgar Language of the Empire which <hi>Alexander</hi> founded.</p>
                     <p>It is known, that from that time the Chriſtians took care to make great numbers of Tranſlations into all the Vulgar Tongues, after the preaching of the Goſpel; and that they preſerved thoſe ancient Books as the firſt Elements of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Now it will be ſufficient to acknowledge thoſe Truths, to conſider;</p>
                     <p>That thoſe Oracles were true which foretold things which happened almoſt four Ages after their Prediction. Thus, for Inſtance, the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46528:170"/>of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Overthrow of the Jewiſh State; the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Service of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Deſtruction of the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchies; are all contained in the Books of <hi>Daniel, Haggai, Zachariah,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there is not more difficulty to conceive, that ſuch Authors as <hi>Iſaiah, Amos, Joel,</hi> ſhould have foretold the ſame thing Eight or Nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before, than there is to believe that they were foretold by thoſe who liv'd but little above Four Ages before they actually came to paſs. There is therefore no difficulty in conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe ancient Oracles were propoſed as we ſee them, and in thoſe times to which we find them fixed.</p>
                     <p>But we ought to go further into this matter, and to eſtabliſh the ſame thing by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs that we might have a ſuſpicion of thoſe Oracles which are not related upon the Faith of a publick Volume. As for Inſtance, thoſe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah, Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Uriah</hi> the Son of <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> who ſeem never to have publiſhed any thing.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to obſerve, 1. That uſually the Authors who publiſh the Oracles, are not the ſame with thoſe who tell us of their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. That the Oracles of which we now ſpeak, were upon Subjects perfectly known, and upon very illuſtrious Exigencies. What more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious than the Deſtruction of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Family, foretold by <hi>Elijah?</hi> What more extraordinary than the manner of <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s Death, foretold by the ſame Prophet?</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:46528:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>In ſhort, we ought to take notice, I. That theſe Oracles were written for the moſt part in compleat Volumes: We have Sixteen Prophets ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd by their proper Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Each of theſe Authors has a very different Character from the reſt; ſo that ſome, as <hi>Daniel</hi> for inſtance, write in a peculiar Language one part of his Book being in <hi>Chaldee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. Every one has ſome relation to the reſt: So thoſe who liv'd together, often treat of the ſame things: So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for inſtance, <hi>Joel, Amos, Hoſea.</hi> But they had ſeparate Idea's, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Oracles, and a turn which perfectly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them one from another.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. One needs only read their Works to find that they wrote in different places. <hi>Amos</hi> was of <hi>Juda,</hi> and went to prohecy in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that appears plainly. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi> that's ſeen by reading their Works.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. There is a natural dependance between the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe of the Prophets in general; For the Prophets were continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Kings and People with the Crimes which they committed againſt the Law of God propoſed by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. There is a natural dependance between the Writings of the former, and of the latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
<note place="margin">Dan. IX. 2.</note> So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is quoted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the time when the Deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were to have an end; this he propoſes, not as if he had learnt it by a Revelation, but as a thing which he had found out by an attentive exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:46528:171"/>
                     <p n="7">VII. There is an exact Connexion of theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles with the Hiſtory of the time, which is often interwoven with the Prophecies. One ſee's it in the Books of <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> the other Hiſtorical Books not being altogether ſo particular, as theſe Prophetical Books are.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. In ſhort, one ſee's that theſe Books are interwoven with Oracles concerning ancient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and People which have now no Exiſtence, ſo tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that hinders us from ſuſpecting any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not repeat here the common Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which eſtabliſh the Credit of theſe Books, I brought in moſt of them when I eſtabliſhed the Authority of the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I ſhall only make ſome Reflexions here, to eſtabliſh the ſame Truth.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the manner of writing the Prophetical Books of the Old Testament, ſhews that thoſe Oracles could not have been forged after their Completion.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſeveral things to taken notice of, to make this Truth more ſenſible. The firſt is taken from the neceſſary connexion of all the parts of the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, the truth of which I have proved by ſeveral Characters. This Hiſtory is exactly written by ſeveral Authors: Now
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46528:172"/>the Hiſtory of the Prophets, and of their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is ſo exactly <hi>framed</hi> into the Hiſtory, that it is impoſſible to take it out, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the whole.</p>
                     <p>The Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which were written by <hi>Samuel,</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and by <hi>Gad,</hi> as appears by I <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 29. contain the Hiſtory from the Year of the World 2888, to the Year 2987.</p>
                     <p>The Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> contain the Hiſtory of the Kings, and of the Prophets, from the Year 2989. to the Year 3442.</p>
                     <p>The Books of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> recapitulate the Hiſtory, from the beginning of the World, to the Year 3468.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ezra</hi> writ his Hiſtory from the Year 3468. to the Year 3538.</p>

                        <hi>Nehemiah</hi> continued it from 3550. to 3563.</p>
                     <p>Here is therefore on the one ſide an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Series of Hiſtory; and on the other ſide a continued Succeſſion of Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David,</hi> who began to Reign in the Year 2950. with ſeveral other Prophets of that time, writ the moſt part of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which are full of Oracles, and which were ſung by the People, as a part of the Divine Service.</p>

                        <hi>Malachy</hi> ſeems to have lived until the Year 3589.</p>
                     <p>Can we therefore in the leaſt imagine that a Hiſtory ſhould be ſo intermixed with Propheſies and Oracles, without conceiving at the ſame time the Truth of both by an invincible neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity?</p>
                     <p>But we may make a ſecond Reflexion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                     <p>There are three general Characters which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Prophets very ſenſibly from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Authors.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. They were publick Cenſors; Let us but read the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s conduct, who called all the Heads of the People, Rulers of <hi>Sodom;</hi> or that of <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> XXXVI. or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prophets in general.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. They were Comforters of the People, when they had brought them to Repentance by their preaching. There are as many Inſtances of this, as there are Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. They foretold remarkable Occurrences, happy or unfortunate, long before there was any probability that they ſhould happen.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to conſider theſe Characters, without ſeeing that the ſtate of Affairs was that which gave a foundation for their Sermons: So that one muſt of neceſſity have framed their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of new, to give ground for a Forgery. This change in the ſtyle of the Prophets, follows the Circumſtances of the Jewiſh State exactly. All
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46528:173"/>that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſay, will hold no longer than whilſt you ſuppoſe the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be as corrupt as the Hiſtory of that time repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it. But if you ſuppoſe it to be as the Hiſtory do's diſtinctly explain it, nothing can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more forcible than their Sermons. For as they joyned Oracles with Promiſes in their <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring</hi> Sermons, ſo one ſee's that they cannot be parted.</p>
                     <p>One may make another Reflexion upon this matter, by ſhewing that theſe Oracles, and theſe Books were ſo famous amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that no Forgery can be ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>The times in which they were writ, are a great proof, for they appeared upon very remarkable Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>One may rank the Prophets into four Orders, according to the ſeveral times in which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: <hi>David,</hi> and the Prophets of his time; Thoſe who lived before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; as <hi>Jonah, Hoſea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Iſaiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Jeremiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Thoſe who propheſied during the Captivity; <hi>Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Thoſe who lived after their Return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; Haggai, Zechariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Now we have an equal Aſſurance of all theſe Prophets, that they were famous.</p>
                     <p>Who can deny the Oracles of <hi>David</hi> to have been famous, when they were preſerv'd amongſt their publick Hymns?</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Micah</hi>'s prediction ſav'd <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> whom they would have condemned for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying the Ruin of the Temple under <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46528:173"/>when <hi>Micah</hi> had propheſied the ſame thing under <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that is to ſay, about One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years before this Prediction of <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> Here's an Event which aſſures us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation, That this Prophecy was very well known: were not therefore the other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which were in the hands of the <hi>Jews</hi> very well known by the whole Nation?</p>
                     <p>The other Prophets lived in very remarkable times: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> under <hi>Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> impious Princes: the laſt of which put him to a cruel Death, for the freedom of his Cenſures and Predictions.</p>
                     <p>There was in the time of every Prophet, a great number of Circumſtances which may be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and which will further prove, That their Works muſt of neceſſity have been very publick, and very famous amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt not here neglect what do's more particularly regard the perſons of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Some of them were Prieſts, that is to ſay publick Miniſters of their Religion. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> were of that number: This may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in reading of their Works, and in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the nature of their Revelations, which were for the moſt part accommodated by God to thoſe Idea's about which the Prophets were moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Some were very illuſtrious by their Birth: Thus <hi>David,</hi> for inſtance, was King of <hi>Iſrael, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> was a Prince of the Blood, and <hi>Daniel</hi> was one of the Princes of <hi>Judah;</hi> which may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily found out by conſidering the Majeſty of their Style, and greatneſs of their Expreſſions.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:46528:174"/>
                     <p n="3">III. Some were very contemptible by their Employment, and by their Birth: So <hi>Amos,</hi> for inſtance, and thoſe other Prophets whoſe Father is barely named, without joyning to it any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title, if the <hi>Jews</hi> obſervation has any ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Now, it is well known, that tho' the gift of Prophecy made him who had it ſufficiently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yet the Character of the Perſon often made the Prophecy famous. Sometimes indeed the meanneſs of the Perſon, as in <hi>Amos,</hi> made the Work to be more regarded, every Body ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion from the ancient Profeſſion or the Prophet, to conſider the Prophecies which he publiſhed with more attention.</p>
                     <p>One ought to obſerve, with care, That thoſe Prophets whoſe Writings are preſerv'd, as well as thoſe who did not write, were continually ſtruck at by falſe Prophets, who oppoſed them with great heat. Since then we have no Prophecies preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but of thoſe whoſe Predictions were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the Event juſtifying the Truth of their Predictions, with regard to particular Facts near the time which they had foretold to eſtabliſh their Authority, whereas the Predictions of others, wanting this Character, were neglected, and at laſt abſolutely loſt: It appears plainly, That thoſe which remain were things of the greateſt Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, I may add, That one needs only read their Books to ſee that they not only foretold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure things, or what particularly concerned their State; but alſo things of a more ſplendid Nature, the overthrow of Kingdoms, of Cities, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46528:174"/>of whole Nations, the Deſtruction of their own City, with its re-eſtabliſhment; Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which would render their Books very illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and which would cauſe them to be read, not only by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo by the Neighbour Nations, the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Aſſyrians, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Is not this therefore a very particular thing, and that which made the Prophets very illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, That the great luſtre of the Prophets conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued but for a certain time: There have been none ſince the Year 3553. their Glory appeared in the Hiſtory of Eight Ages, but it do's not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf any farther: Now why, I pray, ſhould there be no Impoſtors after <hi>Malachy,</hi> as well as there were Impoſtors before him?</p>
                     <p>One may imagine perhaps, That the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were immediately diſperſt, ſome being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one place, and ſome in another: Some in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and others in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Some in <hi>Babylon,</hi> others in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which might give Opportunites for Impoſtors. But,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This Objection may be ſtrongly retorted back: For how can we conceive, that in the Diviſion, which ſeparated the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> would charge themſelves with the Writings publiſhed in a Kingdom ſo much an Enemy to them, without examination, when every thing which comes from thence, ought to appear ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. They were all collected into particular Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes: But the Prophecies of <hi>Hoſea, Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable of the reſt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46528:175"/>are preſerved in Books which contain many other things.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. They are all exactly joyned with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the ſame Nation, each one in a place where there was an equal concern to preſerve, and to gather them together. But beſides, they were all collected into one Body. In ſhort, the LXXII. Interpreters tranſlated them into <hi>Greek</hi> in the Year of the World 3727. and ſo ſubmitted them to the Examination of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and this alſo keeps us from doubting of their Truth.</p>
                     <p>This Tranſlation was made but One hundred thirty and eight years after <hi>Malachy</hi> the laſt of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>But what Judgment ſoever may be made of theſe Reflexions, the Deſign whereof is only to eſtabliſh the Reputation of theſe Prophecies, and of the Books wherein they are written, that ſo no room may be left for any ſuſpicions of Forgery: I ſhall add two Conſiderations to what I have ſaid already, which ought to appear convincing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very attentive man.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One can ſuſpect none but the <hi>Jews</hi> as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of theſe Oracles: Now, not to ſay any any thing of the Abſurdity of ſuppoſing that a whole Nation ſhould have ſubſcribed to ſuch an Impoſture; all the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout the World, were after their return from the Captivity, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of the Meſſiah's being a great Temporal King: and they have the ſame belief to this very hour, in all places of the World, wherever they are diſperſt.</p>
                     <p>This being once laid down, I affirm it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould forge Oracles which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46528:175"/>aſſert expreſly, That the Meſſiah ſhould be put to death in ſo very odious a manner. For, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, the oldeſt Doctors attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Meſſiah, all thoſe Oracles which ſpeak of the Death of the Meſſiah according to the Chriſtians, and which they themſelves in proceſs of time were forced to interpret of two Meſſiah's, one expoſed to a world of Miſeries, and the other only glorious: Or at leaſt, I may ſay it is impoſſible that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould conſent to a Forgery which thwarted their common I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's and Pretenſions in ſo very ſenſible a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond Conſideration eſtabliſhes the ſame Truth with no leſs firmneſs, which is that the Call of the Gentiles to have a ſhare in the Bleſſings of the Covenant which God made with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was the thing in the World from which the <hi>Jews</hi> had the greateſt averſation; they looked upon the Bleſſings which the Meſſiah was to communicate, as advantages entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for thoſe of their own Nation: How then can we conceive that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould forge ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oracles which ſhould thwart their Prejudices ſo ſenſibly? or how can we imagine that a whole People would authorize with their approbation an Impoſture ſo contrary, and ſo very oppoſite to their own Opinions?</p>
                     <p>But it is no hard thing to imagine, That when the <hi>Jews</hi> were once perſwaded of the Authority of their Prophets, either by their Miracles, or by the ready Accompliſhment of every Oracle which they had <hi>publickly</hi> pronounced, that they ſhould receive their Books, with a profound ſubmiſſion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46528:176"/>and preſerve them with the utmoſt care. But it appears to be an incomprehenſible thing, for a People to receive Impoſtures contrary to their Prejudices, and Impoſtures reiterated ſo often, without any ground, but what a vaſt number of Records never before heard of would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                     <p>But I ſuppoſe theſe Reflexions will ſuffice to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the Truth of the Hiſtorical and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Books of the Old Teſtament: So that there will be no need of alledging particular proofs, which might demonſtrate the Truth of each Book in particular, which would carry me out to too great a length.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now conſider the Oracles themſelves, and I ſhall ſhew the progreſs of the Light of this Revelation, with reſpect to the Promiſe of the Meſſiah; That this progreſs may be the better obſerved, I ſhall do three things, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved, without which the mind of a wiſe Reader will not receive ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall explain in a few words the Reaſon why theſe Oracles are interwoven with ſeveral Hiſtories, or Prophecies which ſeem to have no Relation to the Promiſe of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. I ſhall give ſuch Rules as will ſerve to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Application which both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have equally made of ſeveral Oracles only to the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I ſhall ſet the Oracles according to the Order of Time, which will manifeſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and Progreſs of that Light which is to be found in the Revelation it ſelf: As indeed, it is natural to conceive that God ſhould explain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46528:176"/>himſelf more clearly, in this matter, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the things themſelves were nearer to their Completion.</p>

                     <p>ONe of the greateſt Difficulties which may be raiſed againſt the Oracles of the Old Teſtament which concern the Meſſiah, is that ſurprizing mixture which one ſee's of thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and of other Subjects which ſeem to be widely diſtant from any Idea of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>There are none ſo prophane, as to deny, that if in the ſame Author, and in the ſame Chapter, any man ſhould read in one continued Series Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which ſhould explain the miraculous Birth of the Meſſiah, his Family, his Preaching, his Miracles, his Sufferings, his Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion into Heaven, the Sending of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> but that the Hiſtory of the Goſpel would ſufficiently ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Jeſus Chriſt to be the promiſed Meſſiah.</p>

                     <p>They therefore ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles made ſeveral fortunate Alluſions to the more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages in thoſe ancient Authors, which may paſs for Predictions of thoſe Events, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happened; juſt as <hi>Nonnus</hi> wrote the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes; and as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia</hi> made a <hi>Cento</hi> out of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poem, which contained the ſame Hiſtory, tho' neither <hi>Homer</hi> nor <hi>Virgil</hi> had any of the Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion then in view.</p>
                     <p>That this apparent Difficulty may be ſolved, it will be neceſſary to examine Three things: I. The Matter of Fact it ſelf. II. The Reaſons which gave occaſion for the doing of it. III. The Impreſſion which this Fact has produced in the minds of men to this very time.</p>
                     <p>For the Firſt; Tho' it is well known that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe do's not allow men to joyn Foreign I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's in the ſame Diſcourſe, yet we may eaſily conceive that God might and ought to do it, if we will allow what may be eaſily collected, that he reſolved to ſend the Meſſiah into the World: Such a practice was the more natural, becauſe the ancient Patriarchs before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who form'd the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had prepar'd the minds of the People to ſuch ſort of Expreſſions as were raiſed above the preſent Subject.</p>
                     <p>And certainly if one takes but the pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the wiſdom and beauty of the Authors who writ theſe Prophetical Books on the one ſide, and the Character of the Writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46528:179"/>on the other, he would perceive, that if theſe words, <hi>That it might be fulfilled,</hi> were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be changed into theſe, <hi>As one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſort of Completion of ſuch or ſuch Paſſages in the Old Teſtament,</hi> yet notwithſtanding that, the moſt part of thoſe Quotations would evince an exact Accompliſhment, and the Oracles which they alledge would bear a juſt proportion to thoſe Events which are related by the Evangeliſts in our Saviour's Life.</p>
                     <p>Can any thing be more ſingular than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in the Seventh of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> of the Meſſiah's being born of a Virgin; of the piercing of his hands and feet <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXII: of the mixture of Gall which was offered him to drink, hinted at <hi>Pſalm</hi> LX. 22. of his being ſold for Thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Silver: <hi>Zechar.</hi> XI. 3. or then ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a like nature, which at preſent I ſhall not ſtand to reckon up.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be confeſſed however, that theſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are interwoven for the moſt part with Matters relating to Events happening in the time when each Prophet lived, or which ſeem to be applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonally to the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>Three Orders or Reaſons may be conceived, which will juſtifie the Wiſdom of God in the ordering of theſe Oracles in a way which ſeems ſo contrary to the common practice of the World.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Order contains Reaſons drawn from the perſon of the Meſſiah himſelf of whom we ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Order contains thoſe which ariſe from the conſideration of the People amongſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46528:180"/>whom the Meſſiah was to be born.</p>
                     <p>The third contains thoſe Reaſons which reſpect other Nations amongſt whom the Meſſiah was to be preached. I ſhall examine theſe three ſorts by themſelves, and I hope that we may gather from thence, that the Eternal Wiſdom preſided o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this mixture of theſe Oracles which relate to the Meſſiah, with other Idea's which ſeem to be wholly foreign to the Subject.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it may be urged, That the belief of a Meſſiah form'd of ſo apparent Contradictions, cannot eaſily be received of the ſuddain. A Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> calls his <hi>Lord:</hi> a Meſſiah, who complains that he is <hi>forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by God,</hi> whom however he ought to adore: A Meſſiah born with the weakneſſes of Youth, who at the ſame time is called a <hi>mighty God,</hi> and the <hi>Father of Eternity, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, theſe Idea's which ſeem ſo oppoſite ought of neceſſity to have been ſo ſeparated by the Prophets, leaſt they ſhould have been looked upon as Chimerical Deſcriptions, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in one and the ſame Subject.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Reflexion which may be made upon this Matter, is, That the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound not only to preſerve their Oracles, but alſo to execute them in part; Thus for inſtance, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for them to reject the Meſſiah, to deliver him up to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be crucified; there was a neceſſity that their puniſhment ſhould be as ſignal as their Crime, and that they ſhould be diſperſed over the World, after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as the Prophets have clearly ſhewn. Now how could all this have ever been effected, if the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46528:180"/>Deſcription of the Meſſiah by the Prophets had been as Hiſtorical as that of the Apoſtles, or the Evangeliſts, who gave us only a Narrative of Matters of Fact.</p>
                     <p>In a word, was it not the intereſt of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to whom the Goſpel was to be preached, that theſe Oracles ſhould be ſcattered up and down the Writings of theſe ancient Authors? They were to be Called upon the Rejection of the <hi>Jews:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to preſerve the Books of the Old Teſtament, after they were caſt off by God, that the Authority of theſe Books, and theſe Oracles, might be beyond all conteſt, as Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with which we are furniſhed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party, which ought to have place, until the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould profeſs Chriſtianity. Let any one therefore judge if it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this ſtate of Affairs, that there ſhould be ſome obſcurity in the Prophetical Deſcriptions, and by conſequence that this interweaving of foreign Idea's with thoſe which concerned the Meſſiah, as alſo this diſperſion of the Oracles through different places of the Sacred Writers was not neceſſary, and ſo much the more as they were uttered upon ſeveral Occaſions by different Authors.</p>
                     <p>And we may affirm it, as a certainty, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpoſe of God, this obſcurity did not hinder either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> from perceiving thoſe <hi>ruling</hi> Idea's of a Meſſiah, when they read the Old Teſtament. Neither was the diſperſion of theſe Oracles through ſo many different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, any greater hindrance to their application; ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> laid it down as a conſtant Maxime,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46528:181"/>That the accompliſhment of every thing which we find to be foretold as great and illuſtrious by the Prophets, ought to be looked for in the Perſon of the Meſſiah, when the Events of a nearer Date did not anſwer to the greatneſs or magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Predictions.</p>
                     <p>Several Ages had paſſed from the time in which the Prophet had foretold that the Meſſiah was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and yet we ſee that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of it continued very freſh amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt's time, as is plain from the Anſwer which they gave to <hi>Herod.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other Examples might be given, which ſhew that the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time applyed the very ſame Oracles to the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah which we do; and without queſtion, if it had not been ſo, the Apoſtles would firſt have proved that theſe Oracles had relation to the Meſſiah, which they took for granted, as a thing conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, whereas now they only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in the Goſpel to juſtifie that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſiah, by ſhewing one by one that all the Characters which the <hi>Jews</hi> attributed to the Meſſiah, were to be found in him.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it is manifeſt from our Saviour's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the CX <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> could not conceive the Solution of that Difficulty which naturally appears in thoſe words, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand,</hi> yet afterwards they immediately applied that Oracle to the Meſſiah, without ſeeking after any other Subjects to which they might apply it, as the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavour to do at this day.</p>
                     <p>But after theſe Remarks upon the mixture of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46528:181"/>thoſe Oracles which relate to the Meſſiah, with others which ſeem to be of a more foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ought to come to ſome general Rules by which we are to apply the ancient Oracles to the Meſſiah.</p>

                     <head type="sub">General Rules for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of ancient Oracles, and for the Application of them to the Meſſiah.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. AS it appears very natural to conceive, That the moſt ancient Revelations ought to be expreſſed in the moſt general terms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were furtheſt from the time of their accompliſhment, and ſo one ought to find in them a more imperfect delineation of the Deſign of God: yet it is viſible however, that they ought to contribute very much to the underſtanding of thoſe later Oracles, becauſe if theſe later ones do really contain a more particular explication of his Deſign in ſending the Meſſiah into the World, yet they ought always to follow thoſe Idea's which God at firſt made uſe of to make his Deſign known in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is natural to grant, That when God had told the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> that the coming of the Meſſiah was not ſuddainly to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if he intended to bring them to a certain
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46528:182"/>knowledge of the Meſſiah after a long Revolution of years, by thoſe Ceremonial and Judicial Laws which he eſtabliſhed, that he ought to breed them up in an expectation of the Meſſiah, by lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's, and by Oracles which ſhould particularly explain the manner and circumſtances of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is no leſs natural to acknowledge, That when God promiſed ſome illuſtrious Perſon, or ſome great advantage to the Jewiſh Nation, he did it only to entertain the People with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Meſſiah, and upon that account, that he might and ought to joyn the Promiſe of the Meſſiah with it, as the principal Object which the <hi>Jews</hi> ought always to have in view, until it ſhould actually happen.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, there are two ſorts of Oracles in the Old Teſtament: The firſt are ſuch as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to apply to any other beſides the Meſſiah; as for inſtance,
<note place="margin">Gen. III. 15. Deut. XVIII. 15. Deut. XXXIV. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>The place of his Birth; The ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head; The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me; unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> Whereupon he that added the Relation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Death, takes notice that after that there aroſe up no Prophet in <hi>Iſrael</hi> like unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond are ſuch as ſeem to agree in part to ſome body elſe beſides the Meſſiah, tho' we may find there alſo ſuch particular Characters, that it is impoſſible to apply them perfectly; and in their utmoſt extent, according to the whole force of their expreſſion to any other Subject beſides the Meſſiah. And ſo <hi>Balaam</hi> ſeems to have ſpoken of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46528:182"/>
                        <hi>David, Numb.</hi> XXIII. as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate maintains, and of his Victories over the <hi>Moabites</hi> in the ſame place where he promiſes the Meſſiah, and where he ſpeaks of the manner of his ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of <hi>Seth;</hi> And ſo <hi>David</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſpeaks of the oppoſitions which he met with, in his advancement to the Throne, but in Terms too Great and too Emphatical to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to him alone.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Principles which I have now eſtabliſhed, that God promiſed the Meſſiah in general terms, but without any intention of ſending him into the World, until ſeveral Ages had been paſſed, gave riſe to theſe two ſorts of Oracles. On the one ſide, there was a neceſſity of explaining this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe diſtinctly from time to time. And on the other ſide, there was a neceſſity of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to the Deſires of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Idea's with every thing that was great and conſiderable in thoſe Events, and in thoſe Perſons to whom the Prophetick Spirit intended to add a luſtre by its Predictions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> are agreed at preſent, as they were alſo in our Saviour's time, in the application of the moſt part of thoſe Oracles in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Chriſtians apply to the Meſſiah, and if they diſpute ſome of them, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in a ſenſe perfectly forced, yet at leaſt they cannot diſpute theſe following Truths.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That the moſt part of thoſe Oracles which we apply to the Meſſiah, were apply'd in the ſame manner by the Jewiſh Doctors in our Saviours time: As the CX <hi>Pſalm,</hi> for inſtance, which has relation to the Nature and Glory of the Meſſiah;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46528:183"/>the II <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which has reſpect to the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Princes and the People againſt the Meſſiah; that place in <hi>Micah</hi> which fixes the Birth of the Meſſiah to <hi>Bethlehem, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. That as they thought themſelves obliged to make two Meſſiahs, becauſe of the apparent Contradictions which are to be found in thoſe various Events which are apply'd to the Meſſiah in thoſe Predictions; ſome perfectly glorious, and others every way contemptible: ſo there is no injuſtice done, in explaining thoſe Oracles which at firſt ſeem only to have relation to one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of the Meſſiah, and of ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That ſince they themſelves believe, That their Anceſtors might lawfully paſs from one ſenſe to another in their Explications of thoſe Oracles, ſo that they were permitted to apply an Oracle to ſome other Subject, which did not ſeem to agree exactly enough to that Subject which their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had firſt in view, as the particular Subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Oracle treated: So it is not only juſt, but neceſſary too, to paſs from one Subject to another as the Apoſtles have actually done.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That we ought to pay a much greater defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Opinion of the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> than of thoſe, who have been ſowred by their Miſeries and Diſputes to ſuch a degree, that they have loſt that principle of Equity which keeps Men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the moſt evident Truths, and which have been the moſt univerſally acknowledged by a whole Nation, that was not prepoſſeſſed with ſo great a degree of Obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>But we ought to obſerve, beſides, That this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46528:183"/>ſeeming Confuſion of thoſe Oracles which relate to the Meſſiah, with other Subjects treated of by the Prophets, aroſe from ſeveral Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. From the Prophet's often joyning the Idea's of the principal Promiſe, the ſending of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, with the promiſe of thoſe means which were abſolutely neceſſary for the accompliſhment of that promiſe, as the preſervation of the <hi>Jews</hi> for inſtance. So the Captivity of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their departure from thence, with their ſettling in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he had promiſed them before, were foretold, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means in the order of Providence, to the Execution of the great Deſign of God.</p>
                     <p>For ſo the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance there from, which are both foretold, are foretold as ſteps towards the execution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſending the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>And ſo likewiſe when they foretold the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and the other Neighbouring Nations, they alſo foretell the deliverance which God would grant to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment until the Birth of the Meſſiah, which was the accompliſhment of that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. This ſeeming Confuſion aroſe from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe Books piece by piece, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were put into this order, without having always a regard to the time in which they were writ, and without taking notice of all the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which engaged the Prophets to write. And thus we ſee the Prophecies which relate to the Meſſiah joyned to ſeveral other Tranſactions, and to ſeveral other Predictions, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46528:184"/>is not always ſo very evident.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It ariſes from the writing of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies each by themſelves, ſo that all thoſe of the ſame Prophet were put together as they came out, making only a new Chapter in the Work; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ought to be conſidered rather with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Matter, than to the Order in which they lye in the Book, as we have it at the preſent. For the Prophets often borrow their Light from what they themſelves had ſaid ſome time before, or from what ſome other Prophet had foretold, which ought to be obſerved particularly of thoſe who lived about the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>But beſides thoſe Rules which I propoſed in the beginning of this Chapter, and beſides thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the joyning the Oracles which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Meſſiah with other Subjects, I muſt add two Rules more, which may be uſeful in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the ſenſe of great numbers of Oracles which are expreſſed in figurative terms. The firſt is, That it is natural to conceive that when the Prophets were to ſpeak of the Meſſiah, and when they were intent upon the Deſcription of his Kingdom, they ſhould make uſe of Expreſſions which ſeem'd to foretell a ſort of overturning of nature, which ſhould happen at that time: But then theſe Expreſſions ought to be underſtood in a figurative ſenſe, in the ſame Spiritual ſenſe in which the Chriſtians underſtood them, as the famous <hi>Maimonides</hi> allows in that paſſage of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. de <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus,</hi> cap. XII.</note> where the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> are ſaid to feed together.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Since the Meſſiah is deſcribed as one who ſhould unite in his own Perſon, the Glory of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46528:184"/>the Divinity, and the meanneſs of the Human Nature together, we ought to underſtand thoſe Oracles in ſuch a manner, that what is <hi>great</hi> in thoſe Prophetical Deſcriptions, ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the more contemptible part, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Meſſiah as cloathed with all the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Human Nature. Theſe Idea's which are often joyned in one and the ſame Oracles, ought to be exactly applyed to the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which the Prophets had of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, or to thoſe various States through which they themſelves aſſures us that the Meſſiah was to paſs.</p>
                     <p>An intelligent Reader will eaſily judge, that I might have added a third Rule to the two former; which is, That when a perſon, who has all the Characters of a Prophet, applys an old Oracle to any Subject, one cannot reaſonably diſpute his application. This the Chriſtians aſſure us was done by the Apoſtles in a very great number of Oracles. But becauſe this ſuppoſes a Prophetick Character in the Apoſtles before it has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by ſolid proofs, I ſhall wave the propoſal of it at preſent.</p>
                     <p>After theſe general Remarks I ſhall gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether thoſe Oracles in the Old Teſtament, which relate to the Meſſiah; I might here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the order of the Matters, by bringing under each Article thoſe Oracles which relate to it, which would give a great Light to the Subject, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> has rightly obſerved, and as he has pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed himſelf in his Books <hi>de Demonſtratione E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicâ.</hi> However, I rather choſe to follow the Order of Time in which theſe Oracles were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46528:185"/>which did not ſeem improper to explain thoſe Truths which are contained in thoſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, this is of great importance: I. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very natural to conſider the Series of God's deſign, and the connexion which may be found in thoſe Idea's which are made uſe of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Becauſe of the neceſſity of the encreaſe of the Light in the Revelations, proportionably as the time drew near; ſo that, it is of uſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how the Divine Wiſdom follow'd this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order in making the later Oracles clearer than the former, and in hinting by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a greater number of Circumſtances, by which it was neceſſary to explain them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Becauſe this ſerves to give us a very ſtrong proof, That God intended to furniſh us from the Scriptures themſelves, with that which ſhould fix us in a Belief of this Capital Truth in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In ſhort, when the Truth of each of the Books in the Old Teſtament is once approved, and their Age ſet down, it appears that ſeveral Prophets did agree wonderfully without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, in the explication of the ſame Truths at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times, and in ſeveral Places and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which hinder men for the moſt part from agreeing in the moſt common Matters, which are the Subjects of their Reflexions.</p>
                     <p>I have already conſidered that the Wiſdom of God follow'd Rules very conformable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Inclinations of the Patriarchs, when it ſpoke of the Meſſiah. We may ſee the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the following times.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46528:185"/>
                     <p>So ſince God had promiſed Children to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Abel</hi>'s ſtead, one may ſee that he alſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>David</hi> a Son who ſhould ſet upon his Throne. He explains almoſt all the Circumſtances of his Coming, his Humiliation, his Exaltation, the Oppoſitions he ſhould meet with, the Victories he ſhould obtain, and his Offices, Prophetical, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Royal.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's afterwards that the Prophets explain in a more particular manner all theſe Idea's which <hi>David</hi> had already propoſed. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of his Birth by a Virgin, of his Spiritual Gifts, of his Miracles, of his Sufferings, of his Reſurrection, of his Calling of all Nations in to his Worſhip, and of his Caſting off the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who come after point out the place particularly, and the Town where the Meſſiah was to be born; they deſcribe his Covenant, and the Calling of the Gentiles to the Service of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, they deſcribe both the Character of the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, and the Empire under which he was to appear, and the very Year in which he was to dye, as <hi>Daniel</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly doth.</p>
                     <p>I cannot undertake to relate all the Oracles which are contained in the Books of the Old Teſtament, they are ſo very numerous. But I hope at leaſt to mark the more principal, and the moſt illuſtrious ones, and to explain them in ſuch a manner, that all ſhall be obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I. That God deſigned to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofs to his Church, of his deſign in ſending the Meſſiah into the World, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46528:186"/>the continual remembrance of him, as of a Perſon who was promiſed to give all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his Church, and whoſe coming ſhould bring Salvation to all Mankind. II. That the care which he took in ſpecifying all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his coming into the World, ſhew that he deſigned to prevent the Scandal which the abject Life and Death of a Meſſiah might produce, and the falſe Judgments which Men might form of the Works of a Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when they only judge of them by the outſide. III. That he deſigned to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proof, that this ſending of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, was the Work of his Wiſdom and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which at laſt accompliſhed a thing, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign whereof had been propoſed to Mankind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Fall.</p>

                        <hi>Of thoſe Oracles concerning the Meſſiah which are to be found in the Book of</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</head>
                     <p>I Begin with thoſe Oracles which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſince it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to touch them all over again in few words.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Oracle is comprized in theſe Terms,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46528:186"/>
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> III. 15. <hi>I will put Enmity between Thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed; it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Oracle has conſiderable advantages, tho' it is expreſſed in figurative Terms. God uttered it in the beginning of the World, after he had given Sentence againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Woman, and the Serpent in a very ſenſible manner, even under a Human ſhape, if we may dare to affirm it. He uttered it before the Head of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which ought to make it conſiderable to all his Poſterity. He expreſſes it by an Alluſion to the nature of the Temptation, and to the form of the Serpent, which the Tempter had took upon him. He preſerves thereby the memory of the Temptation, by inſpiring all Mankind with an invincible Hatred againſt all Serpents in general, tho' the Tempter had took the ſhape but of one particular kind, for an Inſtrument to accompliſh his Deſign.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, this Oracle clearly ſhews, I. That it ſhould be particularly the Seed of the Woman: <hi>Adam</hi> not being touched at. II. That the Seed of the Woman, that is to ſay the Meſſiah, ſhould deſtroy the power of the Serpent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Head, that is to ſay the power of the Devil. III. That this Seed ſhould however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a conſiderable wound from the Devil, tho' it ſhould only touch his Heel, the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the Meſſiah. IV. That all the Bleſſings which God ſhould give to Mankind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fall, ſhould be grounded upon the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Seed into the World: This is more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46528:187"/>clearly expreſſed by God's telling <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. XXII. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>That in thy Seed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this Oracle <hi>Gen.</hi> III. has relation to the Meſſiah, is plain: I. Becauſe it is the Source and Abridgment of the whole Revelation. II. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> in effect underſtood it ſo. III. Becauſe the Apoſtles, in following the Idea's of the Synagogue plainly referred them to the Meſſiah,
<note place="margin">Targum in h. l.</note> by the Alluſions which they make to them: <hi>John</hi> XII. <hi>Romans.</hi> XVI. II <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 1 <hi>John</hi> III.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Oracle which relates to the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, is contained in theſe Terms, when God ſpoke to <hi>Abraham; In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Oracle is very illuſtrious: I. By the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom God made the Depoſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, and who made himſelf ready to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his own Son. II. By the frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions which God made to this Patriarch, uſing in effect all thoſe ways which he afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in his Revelations to the Patriarchs, for fifty years together, from the Year 2083. to the Year 2133. of the World. III. Becauſe it was accompanied by the Circumciſion, ſo that tho' it foretold that the Advantages ſhould be in common to all Nations, yet it limited the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to be born of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed.</p>
                     <p>It alſo intimates very clearly, I. That the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which it promiſes ſhould be in common to all Nations. II. That this Bleſſing ſhould be quite of another nature from Temporal ones, as the encreaſe for inſtance, and the power of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46528:187"/>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity, which had been promiſed to him before. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Reflexion <hi>Gal.</hi> III. 8. That God ſpake of Seed in the ſingular Number is very remarkable, and ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> make a like Obſervation upon a parallel place in the Old Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>As God repeated this Promiſe when he ſpoke to <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the Year 2200, and to <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Year 2245. <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 14. <hi>And thy Seed ſhall be as the Duſt of the Earth; and thou ſhalt ſpread abroad to the West, and to the Eaſt, and to the North, and to the South: and in thee, and in thy Seed, ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> ſo one ought to repeat again the ſame Reflexions. This ought only to be added, That God reſtrained the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of bringing forth the Meſſiah to <hi>Jacob</hi> the Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that the <hi>Edomites</hi> might not come in to challenge the right, as I have very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly explained in my Reflexions upon <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We come now to the Oracle which <hi>Jacob</hi> gave in the Year 2315. It is one of the cleareſt Predictions in the whole Bible, and it is expreſſed in theſe Terms: Judah, <hi>thou art he whom thy Brethren ſhall praiſe; thy hand ſhall be in the neck of thine Enemies: thy Father's Children ſhall bow down before thee.</hi> Judah <hi>is a Lions whelp; from the Prey my Son thou art gone up: he ſtooped down, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion; who ſhall rouze him up? The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law giver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come, and unto him ſhall the gathering of the People be. Binding his Fole unto the Vine, and his Aſſes Colt unto the choice Vine; he waſhed his Garments in Wine,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46528:188"/>and his Clothes in the Blood of Grapes. His eyes ſhall be red with Wine, and his Teeth white with Milk. Gen.</hi> XLIX. 8.—12. I know very well, that ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> have pretended, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ought to be underſtood for <hi>Shiloh;</hi> But this is ſo ridiculous an Opinion, that there is not the leaſt probability to maintain it: What Scepter had <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> before <hi>Moſes</hi> came? How was <hi>Moſes</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Object of their Hope?</p>
                     <p>And indeed, the Body of the Jewiſh Nation are agreed, that this Oracle was meant of the Meſſiah, ſo <hi>Onkelos</hi> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt, ſo the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, ſo <hi>R. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Jarchi, Abenezra,</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Reflexions may be naturally drawn from this Oracle which <hi>Jacob</hi> uttered upon his Death-bed.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This Oracle is found amongſt a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Oracles which concern the other Tribes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and which were accompliſhed as to every Tribe.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. This Oracle contains ſeveral particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which relate to private Tranſactions in the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. This Oracle was, as it were, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Will in favour of <hi>Judah,</hi> at a time when he divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Children their Portions which they were to expect from him.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. This was a Preference of <hi>Judah,</hi> who was but the fourth, to <hi>Reuben</hi> who was the eldeſt, and who by conſequence ought to have been the Head of his Family. The Scepter, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46528:188"/>of Legiſlator was promiſed to <hi>Judah,</hi> which did not belong to him by the right of his Birth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> therefore prepared his Children to look for an accompliſhment of thoſe Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Judah,</hi> as well for the Kings who were to be deſcended from him, as for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, who were to be bleſſed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Seed.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt go yet further; I ſhall therefore obſerve, I. That this Prophecy particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as all the preceding and following Oracles concern'd thoſe Tribes, whoſe Heads were then named by <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. That this Prophecy concerns the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct eſtabliſhment from the other Tribes. In ſhort, it is certain that the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> had ſome ſuperiority; Thus God for inſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Tribe to march the firſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> II. &amp; X. Its Heads offered their preſents firſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> VII. 11, 12, 83. In <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time this Tribe took its Diviſion without drawing Lots for it. One ſee's that God ordered the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> to lead the People out to the Conqueſt of the reſt of the Country. One ſee's the ſame Prerogatives in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> tho' they were often of other Tribes. From <hi>David</hi>'s time to the taking of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Kings were all of that Tribe; and <hi>Zorobabel</hi> afterwards headed thoſe who returned out of <hi>Chaldea.</hi> The Book of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> names the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> firſt; <hi>Herod</hi> was the firſt King who was wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:46528:189"/>
                     <p n="3">III. That <hi>Jacob</hi> ſuppoſed that the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be in poſſeſſion of a Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of a Community till the coming of the Meſſiah: This was all very proper, and indeed we ſee that this Tribe continued under its own Governours, after the other Tribes had been tranſported, II <hi>Kings</hi> XVII. 18. It almoſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who ſettled in their Country; and indeed <hi>Joſephus</hi> aſſures us, That there were but few of the Ten Tribes who came back again into <hi>Judea</hi> under <hi>Ezra,</hi> for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them ſtayed beyond <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And we ſee that at laſt they gave their Name to the whole Country.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That this Oracle was fulfilled by degrees. This I have obſerved already of the preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> before <hi>David</hi>'s time, which was a ſtep to the advancement of it to the Throne. And the leſſening of their Dignity, which was to be entirely taken away when the Meſſiah came, had alſo the ſame Gradations. <hi>David</hi> was ſet upon the Throne over all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but his Houſe loſt the Government over Ten Tribes in his Grandſon <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s time. His Succeſſors were Tributary to the neighbouring Princes: whereas <hi>David</hi> carried his Empire to the Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> tho' afterwards the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſubdued the <hi>Jews,</hi> and depoſed the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> At laſt they abſolutely loſt all that Authority which they had hitherto kept. They recovered a little in the Perſon of <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and tho' they were ſoon after invaded by the <hi>Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae,</hi> yet the <hi>Maccabees</hi> preſerved them a little, till <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> took away all thoſe Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants which they had yet left.</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:46528:189"/>
                     <p>In carrying theſe Views of this Oracle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may yet further obſerve, I. That God intended to oblige the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to wait for the Scepter in the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> It muſt be there before it could depart thence. It was natural to conceive, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were to look yet much further than <hi>David.</hi> Thoſe words, <hi>It ſhall not depart,</hi> denote a continuance of the Scepter in the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> for ſome conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is eaſie to comprehend a leſſening of the Dignity in the term <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> [See <hi>Judges</hi> V. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] which God ſeems to have made uſe of, as a Mark of the Fall, which I have obſerved in the Perſon of <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> who as to the time was about the middle of the Oracle.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. In a word, it is eaſie to acknowledge that this Oracle aſſigns the <hi>Epocha</hi> in groſs for the time of the coming of the Meſſiah, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ruin of that Authority and Power which the <hi>Jews,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called from the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhould enjoy after their re-eſtabliſhment. God could not explain himſelf more particularly, in ſtating the preciſe time when this thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
                     <p>There are two other very conſiderable Oracles; one uttered by <hi>Balaam</hi> in the Year 2553; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> who had ſent for him to curſe the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that lay in the Plains; the other uttered the ſame Year by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the famous Legiſlator of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the firſt is inſerted by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the XXIV <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi> the other is in the XVIII of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:46528:190"/>
                     <p>The firſt is in theſe words; <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now: I ſhall behold him, but not nigh: there ſhall come a Star out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſhall ſmite all the Corners of</hi> Moab, <hi>and destroy all the Children of</hi> Seth: <hi>And</hi> Edom <hi>ſhall be a Poſſeſſion,</hi> Seir <hi>alſo ſhall be a Poſſeſſion for his Enemies, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall do valiantly. Out of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall come he that ſhall have Dominion, and ſhall deſtroy him that remaineth of the City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ought to obſerve, that <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Character, the preſence of the King and the Elders of <hi>Moab,</hi> and all the Circumſtances in which it was uttered, do advance its Authority conſiderably.</p>
                     <p>But the turn of his Expreſſions is equally ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and remarkable: I. He ſpeaks of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah as of a Star, hinting out to us the Celeſtial Nature of the Meſſiah: whereas hitherto God had only deſcribed him under the Figure of a bare man: tho' the other was made ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, when the Deſtruction of the Empire of the Tempter, and the right of procuring a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto all the Nations of the Earth which he was perſonally to enjoy, were attributed to him; things infinitely beyond the power and condition of Mankind to perform, were attributed to him. II. He obſerves, That this Perſon of whom he ſpeaks ſuch magnificent things, ought however to be deſcended from <hi>Jacob;</hi> which ratifies <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Prophecy in favour of <hi>Judah.</hi> III. Tho' he hints very clearly at the effects of thoſe Bleſſings and Temporal Victories which <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity was to obtain over their Neighbours, yet at the ſame time he infinuates plainly enough, that the beſtowing of the Bleſſing which all the Nations
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46528:190"/>of the World ſhould obtain, was to be reſerved to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Seed; when he refuſed to retract thoſe Promiſes of Bleſſing which God had made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to which Oracles he made a ſenſible Alluſion.</p>
                     <p>And it is very important to conſider that the <hi>Jews</hi> always applyed this Oracle to the Meſſiah, as may be ſeen by their <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt; and it was acknowledged ſo generally, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Achiba,</hi> who lived under the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> pretended that <hi>Barchocheba</hi> was the Meſſiah, becauſe his name was <hi>Chochab,</hi> which is a <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> as if God intended to mark that Impoſtor for the true Meſſiah, by foretelling what name he ſhould be called by.</p>
                     <p>The Oracle which <hi>Moſes</hi> uttered a little before his Death, is very conſiderable. The People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrified with the manner of God's ſpeaking to them upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> deſired that God would no longer ſpeak as he had done before, but that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould give them an Account of whatever God ſhould command. Hereupon God conſents to their Requeſt, and promiſed them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would raiſe them up a Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> to whom they ought to hearken, upon pain of being cut off.</p>
                     <p>He that made the Addition to the laſt Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein his Death is deſcribed, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that there never roſe up afterwards a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in <hi>Iſrael</hi> like to <hi>Moſes:</hi> If it was <hi>Ezra</hi> who made that Addition, then here is a plain and clear deciſion againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome of whom aſſert that <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was the Prophet whom <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſed: If it was <hi>Eleazar,</hi> who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46528:191"/>liv'd in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, then here <hi>Joſhua</hi> at leaſt is excluded from this priviledge of being deſigned by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is to no purpoſe to ſtop at ſuch frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Objections: One needs only obſerve <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Character to take notice of four certain Marks of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prophecies, which advance him infinitely above all the other Prophets. I. He had all the ſorts of Revelations which are generally found amongſt all the Prophets. II. He was illuſtrious for great numbers of Miracles. III. He not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reform'd the Errors and falſe ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then prevailing amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but he ſet up a new Worſhip, and a new Form of Religion. IV. He introduced this Law, and this way of worſhipping God, by ſuch a converſation with God, as one ſee's amongſt two intimate Friends: In which of the Prophets may theſe four Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters be found.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Galileans</hi> themſelves teſtified plainly that theſe Characters ought only to be found in the perſon of the Meſſiah, when they ſaw the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> VI. 14. and the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged the ſame in our Saviours time, when they applyed that Oracle to the Meſſiah, <hi>John</hi> I. 45.</p>
                     <p>But if theſe Oracles were obſcurely hinted at in this Oracle, one may ſee them clearly apply'd to the Meſſiah in the following Oracles, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as the Revelation encreaſed, and as God unravelled the Idea's of theſe ancient Oracles by explaining them more particularly by thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets whom he afterwards raiſed up. This may clearly be ſeen, if we paſs on to thoſe Oracles
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46528:191"/>which were uttered by <hi>David,</hi> and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who lived about his time.</p>

                     <p>THeſe were the Oracles which were the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Meditations of the Faithful from the Year of the World 2553, in which <hi>Moſes</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until <hi>David</hi>'s time, who was particularly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by God to be the only man of <hi>his Family,</hi> which was alſo ſeparated from all the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Judah,</hi> who came from <hi>Pharez,</hi> from whom the Meſſiah was to be deſcended.</p>
                     <p>I have obſerved in another place, that in all probability God raiſed <hi>David</hi> to the Throne, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make the Genealogy of that Family better known, from which the Meſſiah was to ſpring.</p>
                     <p>As this double advancement of <hi>David,</hi> one to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the other to be the Father to the Meſſiah, ought to have inſpired him with lively Reſentments of Gratitude, and as his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles would be much more famous, being uttered by a Royal Prophet, and the rather becauſe God employ'd him in the making a juſt Regulation of the Service of the Sanctuary; ſo we ſee that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> employ'd his Pen in giving more diſtinct Idea's of that Meſſiah which he promiſed them.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:46528:192"/>
                     <p>The Name <hi>Meſſiah</hi> properly ſignifies a perſon conſecrated by anointing to be King, Prieſt, or Prophet. This Name was particularly applyed by <hi>David,</hi> and the Prophets who lived after him, to that holy Seed which God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> by <hi>Judah,</hi> and by <hi>David;</hi> and one may obſerve in <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the Prophets of his time, that they gave the Name of Meſſiah to the promiſed Seed, under one or other of theſe three Senſes.</p>
                     <p>The Characters both of a Prophet and a Prieſt, tho' each of them are auguſt enough, yet yield to that of a King. Theſe are the different Idea's which <hi>David,</hi> and the Prophets of that time follow'd in all the variety of their Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>But it is not my Deſign to give a particular Account of all thoſe Oracles which deſcribe theſe different Characters, for fear of being exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long: So I ſhall content my ſelf with obſerving two things: I. That <hi>David</hi> alone uttered more O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles than all the Prophets who came before him. II. That theſe Oracles of <hi>David</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah are clearer than all the precedent ones.</p>
                     <p>Now, I ſay, that <hi>David</hi> alone uttered more Oracles than any one Prophet who came before him; Thus in the XL <hi>Pſalm</hi> he explains the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by which the Meſſiah became the Servant of God, and clothed himſelf with the form of a Servant, to offer unto God a more perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience than that which had formerly been offered by Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices. He deſcribes the meaſure and the Nature of his Miniſtry, which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46528:192"/>was to conſiſt in the inſtruction of the People, in Righteouſneſs, Truth, and the Salvation of God. <hi>Pſalm</hi> XL. 7.—11. <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou didſt not deſire, mine Ears haſt thou opened: Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering and Sin offering haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, Lo I come; in the Volume of the Book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within my heart. I have preached Righteouſneſs in the great Congregation: Lo I have not refrained my Lips, O Lord, thou knoweſt: I have not hid thy Righteouſneſs within my heart, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thy Faithfulneſs, and thy Salvation: I have not concealed thy loving Kindneſs, and thy Truth, from the great Congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the XVI <hi>Pſalm</hi> he deſcribes the inviolable ſtedfaſtneſs of the Meſſiah to the Service of God, who had ſent him to form a great People; with the manner of his deliverance by God from all the powers of the World, by raiſing him up from the dead, and afterwards receiving him into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Pſalm</hi> XVI. 8. &amp;c. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth; my fleſh alſo ſhall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell; neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption: Thou wilt ſhew me the path of Life; in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy: at thy right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the XXII <hi>Pſalm</hi> he deſcribes the Agonies through which the Meſſiah was to paſs, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Death, the Victory which he ſhould obtain over his Enemies, and the Converſion of thoſe very Nations which had caſt him off.</p>

                     <p>In the CIX <hi>Pſalm</hi> he ſpeaks of the Oppreſſions of the Meſſiah, pronouncing great numbers of Imprecations againſt that very perſon who ſhould ſignalize himſelf by perſecuting his Innocence. <hi>Hold not thy peace O God of my praiſe: for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened againſt me; they have ſpoken against me with a lying tongue,</hi> Verſe 1, 2. <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan ſtand at his right hand. When he ſhall be judged, let him be condemned, and let his prayer become Sin. Let his days be few, and let another take his Office,</hi> Verſe 6, 7, 8. <hi>Becauſe that he remembred not to ſhew mercy, but perſecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even ſlay the broken in heart. As he loved curſing, ſo let it come to him: as he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be far from him. As he clothed himſelf with curſing like as with his Garment, ſo let it come into his bowels like water, and like oyl into his bones,</hi> Verſe 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>In the CXIX <hi>Pſalm</hi> he carries this Argument further, in his Deſcription of the Zeal of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah for the Houſe of God, and of thoſe inſultings which he ſhould meet with, and the manner of their giving him Vinegar and Gall to drink, with the hardning and rejection of thoſe who had uſed him in that manner. <hi>Save me O God, for the waters are come in unto my ſoul. I ſink in deep mire, where there is no ſtanding: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me,</hi> Verſe 1, 2. <hi>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord Ged of Hoſts, be aſhamed for my ſake: Let not thoſe that ſeek thee be confounded for my ſake, O God of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Becauſe for thy ſake I have born reproach; ſhame hath

Let their Table become a ſnare before them; and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

                     <p>In the XCVII and XCVIII <hi>Pſalms</hi> he deſcribes the deſtruction of Idolatry when the promiſed Saviour ſhould appear, and when God ſhould raiſe him upon his Throne. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the Earth rejoyce; let the multitude of the Iſles be glad thereof.</hi> Pſalm XCVII. 1. <hi>Confounded be all they that ſerve graven Images, that boast themſelves of Idols: worſhip him all ye Gods.</hi> Zion <hi>heard, and was glad, and the Daughters of</hi> Judah <hi>rejoyced; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy Judgments, O Lord: For thou Lord art high above all the Earth: thou art exalted far above all Gods,</hi> Verſe 7, 8, 9. <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new Song, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm have gotten him the Victory.

                     <p>In the LXVIII <hi>Pſalm</hi> he explains the glory of the Meſſiah, and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, with the effuſion of thoſe gifts which he was to ſpread abroad for the Converſion of the Nations, that God might dwell amongſt the moſt rebellious. <hi>Princes ſhall come out of</hi> Egypt, Ethiopia <hi>ſhall ſoon ſtretch out her hands unto God: Sing unto God, ye Kingdoms of the Earth: O ſing praiſes unto the Lord. To him who rideth upon the Heavens of Heavens, which were of old; lo he doth ſend out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

                     <p>The Prophets who lived in the time of <hi>David,</hi> or ſoon after, purſued all his Idea's. One ſee's that <hi>Nathan,</hi> II <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. foretells <hi>Solomon</hi>'s glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the honour which he ſhould have in building that Temple of which <hi>David</hi> had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſign before, in ſuch a manner, that he clearly ſhews three things which will by no means agree with <hi>Solomon.</hi> I. That God ſhould raiſe up a Son to <hi>David</hi> after his Death, and place him upon his Throne; whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> was born, and advanced to the Throne by <hi>David</hi> himſelf. II. It was promiſed that his Government ſhould be endleſs; this is not applicable to the Royal Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> who had but Twenty Succeſſors who bore the Title of Kings. III. That God parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly promiſes to be the Father of this promiſed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46528:194"/>Son, which is not more applicable to <hi>Solomon,</hi> than to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Corah</hi>'s Poſterity gave that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s glory upon his marriage with the King of <hi>Egypt's</hi> Daughter; He ſpeaks of a Throne much more auguſt then that Princes was, and he repreſents to us a God conſecrated with Oyl of Gladneſs above his Fellows. This exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets forth the auguſt Character of the Meſſiah, and his Anointing to be the King of all Nations, their Prophet, and their Prieſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi> XLV. 1. <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter: I ſpeak of the things which I have made touching the King: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</hi> Verſe 7, 8. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the Scepter of thy Kingdom is a right Scepter. Thou loveſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and hateſt wickedneſs; therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi> Verſe 16. <hi>Inſtead of thy Fathers ſhall be thy Children whom thou maiſt make Princes in all the Earth.</hi>

                     <p>One ſee's the ſame Prophets inviting all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the XLVII <hi>Pſalm</hi> to acknowledge the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: which <hi>Daniel</hi> afterwards deſcribes as that which the <hi>Jews</hi> already knew was to be governed by the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's <hi>Aſaph</hi> deſcribing in the L <hi>Pſalm</hi> the manner of the Meſſiah's aſſembling all People, and of his rejecting the ancient and Legal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and preſcribing a Spiritual one, even Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Vows, and of Praiſe. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>And the Heavens ſhall declare his Righteouſneſs: for God is Judge himſelf.

                     <p>One ſees that <hi>Ethan</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite,</hi> who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us as the wiſeſt Man in that Age after <hi>Solomon,</hi> explains the promiſe made to <hi>David</hi> of a Son who ſhould reign for ever, and whoſe Throne ſhould be immoveable in the LXXXIX <hi>Pſalm.</hi> This agrees to none but the Meſſiah, whom he deſcribes as the Firſt-born of the Princes of the Earth, and as the Son of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46528:195"/>God in a manner, which is not applicable to any of <hi>David</hi>'s Poſterity, except only to the Meſſiah. <hi>Verſe</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to the holy one, and ſay'ſt, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one choſen out of the people. I have found</hi> David <hi>my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; with my holy Oyl have I anointed him.</hi> Verſe 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>My Faithfulneſs and my Mercy ſhall be with him; and in my Name ſhall his Horn be exalted. I will ſet his Hand alſo in the Sea, and his right hand in the Rivers. He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my Salvation. Alſo I will make him my Firſt-born, higher than the Kings of the Earth. My Mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him. His Seed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will I make to endure for ever, and his Throne as the days of Heaven.</hi> Verſe 33.34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>Nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lye unto</hi> David. <hi>His Seed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me: It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful Witneſs in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One needs only read over the <hi>Pſalms</hi> which I have now taken notice of, and which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all applyed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Meſſiah, to ſee the great Number of Oracles which God gave in <hi>David</hi>'s time, concerning this matter; not to ſpeak of thoſe which deſcribe the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which fill up the

                     <p>I come now to the proof of the ſecond Article, which is to ſhew, That the Oracles which <hi>David</hi> uttered are much clearer, and much more particular than thoſe which were given before. This I hope to prove beyond all contradiction, by conſidering two <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the one whereof deſcribes the prodigious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of the Meſſiah; and the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes his Advancement at the right hand of God; two of the greateſt Truths declared by the Prophets, and two the moſt ſingular of all the Characters which belong to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah.</hi>

                     <p>IT cannot be deny'd, when one reads the XXII <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but that the perſon there ſpoken of, is deſcribed figuratively, as one expoſed to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Sufferings, from which he is afterwards deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Divine aſſiſtance, and advanced to rule an Empire which extends it ſelf over all the Nations of the World, and afterwards univerſally adored.</p>

                     <p n="3">III. He takes notice, that thoſe who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Sufferings, made a mock at them, bidding him truſt in God, that he might deliver him.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. He ranks his Enemies amongſt the Bulls of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and raging Lions, who (according to the Prophetical way of ſpeaking) are the chief Men in the Nation. <hi>Amos</hi> IV. 1. <hi>Ezech.</hi> XXII. 25.</p>

                     <p n="7">VII. He ſhews that he was ſtretched out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſuch a manner that they might count all his Bones; this expreſſes the Idea of a Man faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Croſs, and expoſed to the view of all the World; as he afterwards deſcribes himſelf to be quite dry'd up, from the loſs of Blood when he was crucify'd.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. He takes notice of their parting his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and</p>

                     <p>In ſhort, one ſee's throughout all the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> the Image of a Death which was equally ſhameful and cruel.</p>
                     <p>The other part of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the deliverance of that perſon who is mentioned in this holy Hymn.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. He obliges himſelf, to praiſe the Name of

                     <p n="3">III. At laſt, he takes notice that the Kingdom of God ſhould ſpread it ſelf over all the Nations of the World.</p>
                     <p>One may judge by the Hiſtory of <hi>David,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is applicable to him; therein we may ſee all the Croſſes which he underwent particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly repreſented, during all the former years of his Reign. But there we have no Account, that <hi>David</hi> ever ſuffered any thing like that which is ſo exactly deſcribed in this <hi>Pſalm.</hi> And this may be ſaid further, that when <hi>David</hi> took any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to paint out his Sufferings to us, he has put in ſeveral ſtroaks which only relate to the Meſſiah, and which ſhew us in a very lively manner, that he was to paſs through much greater Tryals than any of thoſe from which <hi>David</hi> had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The later <hi>Jews,</hi> who endeavour to verifie this Prophecy in <hi>Eſther</hi> or <hi>Mordecai,</hi> agree with us at the bottom, that <hi>David</hi> carried his views further than barely his own Sufferings. And thoſe alſo who apply it to the poople of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame Truth even againſt their wills.</p>
                     <p>But the more ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were more equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their applications of the XXII <hi>Pſalm</hi> to the Meſſiah. They applyed it to him in earneſt, even after the time of Jeſus Chriſt, when the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46528:197"/>of theſe Characters of the Meſſiah, which may be found ſo exactly in the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, led them to an oppoſition of this Truth.</p>
                     <p>And certainly there needs very little equity to acknowledge that this Oracle, or rather this heap of Oracles belong'd to the Meſſiah, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and agreement of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. They had not then reſolved to make their advantages of the Writer's fault, who writ [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>] <hi>like a Lion,</hi> inſtead of [<gap reason="foreign">

In ſhort, <hi>Aquila</hi> who lived 100 years after Jeſus Chriſt, and the other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Interpreters, <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotion,</hi> tranſlated that paſſage as we now read <hi>it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Notion which the Synagogue always had of the Sufferings of the Meſſiah, obliged them to ſuppoſe two Meſſiahs, one ſuffering, and the other glorious, rather than to contradict that Truth openly, which is expreſſed by theſe Oracles in ſoparticular a manner.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Nothing can be imagined to be more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, than to ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould quote the firſt words of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> upon the Croſs, thereby to engage all Mankind to take notice of the accompliſhment of this ancient Oracle in all his Sufferings, if we ſuppoſe that this <hi>Pſalm</hi> even by the confeſſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had no relation to the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Reflexion may be made concerning the Apoſtles, who have quoted ſo many paſſages of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> to prove that Jeſus Chriſt was the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46528:198"/>Meſſiah; becauſe one may find in his Death, and in the Circumſtances of it, ſuch a litteral and exact accompliſhment of this ancient Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                     <p>But if it ſhould be objected, That after all, this agreement of the Synagogue can make no more than a ſtrong prejudice; this may be eaſily anſwered; by conſidering that when the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaks of the extent of his Kingdom over the whole Earth, it was that Circumſtance which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Synagogue in their application of this whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> to the Meſſiah; becauſe as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves acknowledge, this extent of Empire is one of thoſe Characters, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient Oracles, is applicable to none but the Meſſiah. In ſhort, (becauſe it is of great importance, I ſhall repeat it here again) common ſenſe led thoſe who conſidered theſe ancient Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to compare them (as naturally they ought) with thoſe that went before, and to determine the ſcope and intent of the later ones by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they had to the precedent ones; and there was only need of one conſiderable Clauſe to make a certain determination after they had made ſuch a compariſon. This the <hi>Jews</hi> were certainly convinced of, when they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the laſt words of <hi>David,</hi> II <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIII. 1-8. were to be applyed to the Meſſiah, by comparing them with <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Oracle of the Meſſiah, <hi>Numb.</hi> XXIV.</p>
                     <p>We may therefore take it for granted, That <hi>David</hi> did not abſolutely ſpeak of himſelf in the XXII <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and that he carried his views as far as the Meſſiah, that he gave a great number of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46528:198"/>Characters to his Poſterity, whereby they might diſtinguiſh, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of his Sufferings, and even the better by his very Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, than which no clearer marks can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be given; becauſe there is nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary than enduring of Miſeries, nor nothing which depends leſs upon the choice of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is to undergo them, than the particular kind of puniſhment, or than the Circumſtances which muſt accompany his Death, when it is once left to the unjuſt power of violent Enemies.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the CX <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which in a very few words contains ſeveral very important Characters of the Meſſiah, which are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>If one conſiders it exactly, it ſeems to have been compoſed after that <hi>Nathan</hi> had acquainted <hi>David</hi> with the Glory of his Son which God had promiſed him; ſuch a Son who ſhould build a Houſe wherein God ſhould dwell for ever, and who ſhould ſit upon a Throne which ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be overturned; whereas <hi>David</hi> had only form'd a Deſign of Building a Temple to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, one ſee's that the Spirit of Prophecy had given him a view of the Glory of this auguſt King who ſhould be born of his Seed, and of the Glory of his Kingdom which ſhould never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd. <hi>David</hi> advances this King not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all MEN, by calling him <hi>his Lord</hi> who was himſelf a King; but alſo above the Angels, by making him ſit at the right hand of God in the Kingdom of Heaven. This is perſonal. He alſo deſcribes the Glory of his Office, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46528:199"/>him as a Prieſt of a higher order than that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> from whom <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> received Tithes in the perſon of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And, in a word, he acquaints us with the progreſs of his Kingdom, and the greatneſs of his Victories. Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all theſe Characters by themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. He brings in God ſpeaking to the Meſſiah, whom he calls <hi>his Lord; Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy Enemies thy footſtool.</hi> This points out to us, 1. That the Meſſiah ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Glory. 2. That God intended to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his Enemies by little and little, whilſt the Meſſiah ſhould be in his Glory; as it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Second <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. He obſerves, That the Empire of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to begin at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Sion,</hi> which was then to be under the power of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. He expreſly points out the quick extent of the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe who ſhould ſubmit to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint or violence, which was much pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. He poſitively aſſerts, That the Meſſiah ſhould be eſtabliſhed a <hi>Prieſt after the order of</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech, which would overturn the whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Prieſthood, which then was to have an end: Yet the very ſame King who deſigned the Draught of the Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> built ſome time after, undermines the Foundations of this material Building, and clearly ſuppoſes that the Levitical Miniſtry, which was fixed to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Temple, ſhould laſt no longer than until the Coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46528:199"/>
                     <p n="5">V. He particularly takes notice, That the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſhould, by the Divine Aſſiſtance, deſtroy all that ſhould oppoſe his power, and ſhould bring all things under his Dominion, as a Conquerour who ſhould overturn all things with the utmoſt violence.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be greater than theſe ſeveral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; nothing can be more particular than his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Glory to which the Meſſiah was to be advanced after that prodigious Humiliation which is deſcribed in the XXII <hi>Pſalm;</hi> But what can we ſuppoſe to be the reaſon of <hi>David</hi>'s ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Meſſiah in this <hi>Pſalm?</hi> This I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider.</p>
                     <p>One may ſay that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not conſtantly apply theſe Prophecies to the Meſſiah, before the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt without good grounds: They could not apply them to any of <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſors; none of <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſors was both King and Prieſt. <hi>Uzziah</hi> was the only man who dared to uſurp the Prieſthood; and he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God himſelf. The <hi>Maccabees</hi> were not of <hi>David</hi>'s Tribe, but were <hi>Levites,</hi> and none of them ever went up into Heaven to ſet at the right hand of God. Beſides, their Kingdom did not begin in <hi>Sion,</hi> and they never brought any other Kings under their Authority. They applyed it therefore to the Meſſiah, purſuant to the Maxim which they drew from a frequent meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ancient Oracles, that we ought only to look for an accompliſhment of thoſe Prophecies in the perſon of the Meſſiah, which they could never ſind to be fulfilled any where elſe, when at the ſame time they knew that the exactneſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46528:200"/>and truth of thoſe Predictions could not be any ways conteſted.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it plainly appears that they did unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly apply it to the Meſſiah before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came into the World, from the manner of their confeſſing it to our Saviour, when he preſſed them with the CX <hi>Pſalm;</hi> tho' they could not explain the manner how <hi>David</hi> ſhould call the Meſſiah Lord, when they allow'd him to be his Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> XXII. 48.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's nothing ſo frequently urg'd by the Apoſtles as this CX <hi>Pſalm;</hi> they uſe it upon all Occaſions to prove that Jeſus Chriſt had the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the true Meſſiah, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> had given him in the CX <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſuppoſing ſtill, as a thing beyond diſpute, that <hi>David</hi> ſpoke of the Meſſiah in this famous Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>So that what Evaſions ſoever the <hi>Jews</hi> may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make uſe of, yet they cannot deny but that their moſt famous Doctors ſince Jeſus Chriſt, have upon ſeveral Occaſions follow'd the old Notions of the Synagogue in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. One finds in their Writings great numbers of Teſtimonies which confirm this Truth. I ſhall not mention them at preſent, becauſe they are well enough known, and becauſe I would make haſte to come to that new degree of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which God gave to thoſe Prophets who gave new Characters of the Meſſiah to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation for ſome Ages after <hi>David</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <p>They are in too great a number to be ſpoken of, one by one, and I am forced to range them under certain Heads; tho' I intend at the ſame time to make more particular Reflexions upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46528:200"/>ſome of thoſe which give us an account of the moſt remarkable Truths, and ſo by that means furniſh us with the moſt ſenſible Character where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may know more certainly the perſon whom God propoſed to his People in ſuch a manner as the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whom he had before called <hi>The Expectation of the Gentiles.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">That the Meſſiah was to have a Forerunner, and what was to be his Character.</head>
                     <p>WE ſhall make it manifeſt in the ſequel of the Diſcourſe, That the Meſſiah was to appear in a very deſpicable ſtate, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his Appearance would be very diſtaſtful to thoſe who expected him in the ſplendour of a great King and Conquerour. To oppoſe this preconceived Opinion of theirs, the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thought fit to appoint one to be his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, who ſhould call the <hi>Jews</hi> to Repentance, and a Reformation of their Lives, and form in them a true Notion of the Miniſtry of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, as of a Perſon who was to preſcribe to them Laws of the greateſt purity and holineſs. And indeed, in examining the holy Scriptures, we find,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46528:201"/>That the Appearance of the Meſſiah was to be uſher'd in by a Perſon thus diſtinguiſh'd; the following Prophecies are very expreſs to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe we find in the XL of <hi>Iſaiah, verſe</hi> 3. where the Prophet ſpeaks thus, before the Deſtruction of the firſt Temple;
<note place="margin">Iſai. XL. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>The voice of him that crieth in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtraight in the Deſert a High way for our God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Abenezra.</note> The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge that this Chapter ſpeaks of the comfort the Meſſiah was to procure for his People, and that the Voice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd here refers to thoſe who were to declare and proclaim his Coming.</p>
                     <p>We meet with a ſecond Prophecy in <hi>Malachy,</hi> who prophecied after the Rebuilding of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and who having ſhut up the Viſion, preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points at the Time wherein he was to appear, <hi>viz.</hi> during the ſecond Temple, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Behold, I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddainly come to his Temple; even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, behold he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of Hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? And who ſhall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers ſope. And he ſhall ſit as a Refiner and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifier of Silver: and he ſhall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> own that theſe words alſo of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">R. Saad.</note> ſpeak of the Forerunner of the Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>But we ought to obſerve in the foregoing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, 1. That they have a manifeſt Relation to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46528:201"/>the Time of the Meſſiah's coming; ſhould the <hi>Jews</hi> deny this (as indeed they unanimouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it) it would be an eaſie matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, 1. By urging the Authority of the Evangeliſts, who apply theſe very Paſſages to the Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> Thus we find that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St.
<note place="margin">Matth. III. 1 Mark I. 2</note> 
                        <hi>Mark</hi> make a manifeſt Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to theſe two Prophecies: <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo, the Father of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> applyes that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to his Son; and his Authority is the more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe he was a Prieſt. 2. By an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſidering the Paſſages themſelves. 3. By the common conſent of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, who by a generally received and undoubted Tradition, that <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>Tiſhbite</hi> (the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of that place of <hi>Malachy</hi> telling us as much) was to be the Forerunner of the Meſſiah; and we find, that in the time of our Saviour, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and his Diſciples ſuppoſed the ſame thing: And the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day have the ſame perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Elias</hi> is to come before the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Meſſiah; from which Tradition of the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old did, and many at this day do believe, That <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall reſume the Functions of his Miniſtry before the laſt coming of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>to Judge the Quick and the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may obſerve, That the Character of the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, being that which the <hi>Jews</hi> had much in their eye, it was needful for it to be as notable and extraordinary, as was that of the Prophet <hi>Elias;</hi> whoſe Miniſtry was without diſpute the moſt remarkable and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the Prophets ſince <hi>Moſes;</hi> which gave the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> occaſion to call him <hi>Elias,</hi> much
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46528:202"/>upon a like account as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls the Meſſiah,

                        <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But above all things, we muſt carefully obſerve the ſeveral Marks the Prophets give us of this Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives us theſe following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: 1. That his Miniſtry was to be very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and attended with general Reſpect and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. 2. That he was to preach in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. 3. That he was to call Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 4. That he was to confound thoſe who were moſt eminent in Authority, and to comfort the Poor and Humble. 5. That he was immediately to precede the Meſſiah. 6. That his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was to uſher in that grand Revelation of the Glory of God in the preſence of all Fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> before all Nations of the Earth, who were to be called by the Meſſiah to his Religion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the expreſs Declaration of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> doth moſt diſtinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to us, 1. That the Miſſion of this Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner was not far off, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſend my Meſſenger.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as of a thing at the Door. Now it is evident, and the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves own it, That from the Time of <hi>Malachy,</hi> there was never a Prophet till the Appearance of <hi>John the Baptist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It tells us that this <hi>Elias</hi> was to call Sinners to Repentance, and <hi>to prepare the way before the face of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he was immediately to precede the Meſſias; this he expreſſes by ſaying, <hi>And the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddainly come to his Temple, even the Angel of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> It
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46528:202"/>is evident that he ſpeaks here of the Meſſiah, whom he calls,
<note place="margin">Pſalm II.</note> not only <hi>the Angel or Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> but alſo <hi>the Lord; The Lord,</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God had promiſed him as a King to the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> becauſe God by him was to make a new Covenant with the Nations of the Earth, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> declares <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXI.</p>

                     <p>THE preceding Mark of the Meſſiah, leads us to this we are now to ſpeak of, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords it conſiderable Light. I will not repeat here what I have already ſet down concerning that Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> XLIX. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. concerning the Time when our Saviour was to appear in the World: It is evident at firſt ſight, That that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy evidences Three things: 1. That the <hi>Scepter</hi> was to be in the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> before ever the <hi>Shiloh</hi> was to come. 2. That the <hi>Scepter</hi> was to give way to an inferiour Dignity, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſets forth by the word <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> and which did take place till the time of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46528:203"/>his Succeſſors. 3. There was a neceſſity that this laſt Dignity alſo was to come to an end, which happened not till the Advancement of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> the Great to the Throne of <hi>Judea.</hi> And it is eaſie to confirm this Truth, by other Oracles which give a further Light to this our Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeveral that are very remarkable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account: The firſt is that of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> II. <hi>verſe</hi> 40, 41, 42, <hi>to</hi> 46. where he firſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Succeſſion of ſeveral Monarchies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that of the Meſſiah. 2. The Time in which the Meſſiah was to appear. I confeſs he do's not determine the Time very preciſely, mentioning only the Monarchy during which he was to be manifeſted; but to make amends for this, when he comes to explain the particulars of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which before he had propos'd in general terms; he doth not only point at the time of his Appearance, but the very Year of his Death, and he do's it with that exactneſs, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be miſtaken about it.</p>
                     <p>See what he ſaith in the IX <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, Verſe</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy People, and upon thy Holy City, to finiſh the Tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of Sins, and to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in Everlasting Righteouſneſs, and to Seal up the Viſion and Prophecy, and to Anoint the moſt Holy.</hi> Verſe 25. <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandment to reſtore and build</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be Seven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks, the Streets ſhall be built again, and the Wall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46528:260"/>even in troublous times.</hi> Verſe 26. <hi>And after the Threeſcore and two weeks ſhall</hi> MESSIAH <hi>be cut off, but not for himſelf. And the People of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and the end thereof ſhall be with a Flood, and unto the end of the War deſolations are determined.</hi> Verſe 27. <hi>And he ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one week, and in the midſt of the week he ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice and Oblation to ceaſe, and for the over-ſpreading of Abomination, he ſhall make it deſolate, even until the Conſummation, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſhall be poured on the deſolate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the underſtanding of this Prophecy which is ſo exact, and all the Events it refers to, ſo particularized, it is to be obſerved:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by the Weeks <hi>Daniel</hi> here ſpeaks of, Seven Years are deſigned, according to the Stile of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXV. 8. when it ſpeaks of the Year of Jubilee; ſo that Seventy Weeks make out 490 Years, which is acknowledged by the moſt Learned amongſt the <hi>Jews, Jachiades, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbanel,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Prophet writing in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Account of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Year, which conſiſts of 360 days, as appears clearly from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages of this Book, where he reſolves the Years into Days, without regarding the ſeveral Days which in a juſt Calculation were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Prophet expreſſes a certain <hi>Epocha,</hi> from whence the counting of theſe Weeks is to begin, <hi>viz.</hi> an Order to rebuild the Temple, which cannot be applyed to that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was in a manner of none effect; nor to the

                     <p n="4">4. For though there be but 483 Solar Years from the 20 of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to the firſt of <hi>Cajus Caligula,</hi> yet we ſhall find the juſt Number of 490 Years, if we follow the <hi>Chaldean</hi> way of Calculation, in which they reckon 360 Days to a Year. And indeed we find juſt 483 ſuch Years from the 20 Year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to the time wherein all <hi>Judea</hi> was in expectation of the Meſſiah. It was then Jeſus Chriſt was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. He ſuffer'd Death Three Years and a Half after his Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nineteenth Year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> before the Seventh Week was ended, and the Term pointed out by <hi>Daniel</hi> was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>I know that ſome famous Men begin the Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> from the Second Year of <hi>Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and make them to end with the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which happend in the Year 490, accounting from the Second Year of the ſaid <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> and they conceive themſelves oblig'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by an Argument, they believe invincible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from the Second Year of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> to the Thirty Second of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46528:205"/>find juſt Forty nine years, that is the Seven Weeks deſigned by <hi>Daniel</hi> for rebuilding of the Ruins, and fortifying of the City; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe <hi>Nehemiah</hi> return'd to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the Thirty ſecond Year of his Reign, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that work, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> XIII. 6. But this Opinion cannot ſtand, for theſe two Reaſons which ſeem to me to be unanſwerable: The firſt is, Becauſe they ſuppoſe that <hi>Daniel</hi> ends his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Weeks at the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas indeed he ſaith no ſuch thing, but expreſly tells us that the Meſſiah ſhould be cut off in the midſt of the Seventieth Week. The ſecond is, That ſo, without deſigning it, they rob Jeſus Chriſt of the Glory, of having determined the Time of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Prophecy concerning that Event, he had only given us an Explication of that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> Neither will I make any further ſtop here, to obſerve, That that which has given moſt trouble to Interpreters, hath proceeded from the want of making an exact diſtribution of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of that Prophecy, which very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly delivers three things: 1. The end of the Prophecy, which happened after Seven Weeks in the time of <hi>Malachy.</hi> 2. The Death of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, which came to paſs in the midſt of the laſt Week of the 490 Years. 3. The Peace which was to be made in the midſt of one Week, that is Three years and an half before the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was done not by the Meſſiah, as ſome have imagined, but by the <hi>Romans</hi> who made Peace with the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Annal.</hi> Lib. XV.</note> as is recorded by <hi>Tacitus.</hi> An intelligent Reader will eaſily judge,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46528:206"/>That this diverſity of Opinions concerning the meaning of this Oracle, has been occaſioned by want of attention to what has been now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Obſervations being ſuppoſed, as indeed they are Matters of the greateſt Evidence, it neceſſarily follows, That the Meſſiah was to appear before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Time is ſet down ſo preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as leaves no pretence to doubt of this Truth. And indeed, tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeem preſently after the time of our Saviour, to have adopted the Opinion I mentioned before, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to receive the Meſſiah, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carried it to the end of the Seventy Weeks, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Deſtruction of their Temple, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Daniel</hi> expreſly tells us, That the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not to be deſtroyed till after the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Meſſias. The <hi>Jews,</hi> I ſay, being convinc'd by the force of this Argument, have owned that the Meſſiah was born at the time of the Deſtruction of the ſecond Temple, but that he has hid himſelf ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Oracle concerning the Time of the Coming of the Meſſiah, is, That of <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai,</hi> which expreſly tells us, that the Meſſiah was to appear during the ſecond Temple, which was begun to be built by the Order of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed under <hi>Darius</hi> Son of <hi>Hystaſpes,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> The Words of the Prophet are as follows, <hi>Chap.</hi> II. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>And I will ſhake all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come; and I will fill this Houſe with Glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. The Silver is mine, and the Gold is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46528:206"/>mine, ſaith the Lord of Hosts. The Glory of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Houſe ſhall be greater than that of the former ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: and in this place will I give Peace, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> It is worth our noting, 1. That this Oracle promiſes a very great change. 2. It deſcribes the Meſſiah as the Expectation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuitable to the Idea God had given of him to <hi>Abraham.</hi> 3. That it fixes the Coming of the Meſſiah to the Time of the ſecond Houſe, that is to ſay, of the Temple built by <hi>Zorobabel.</hi> 4. It makes the Glory of that Houſe to depend upon its being honoured with the preſence of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, if we would be convinc'd of this Truth, we need only conſider three things: The firſt is, That the Prophets <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> do repreſent to us the Coming of the Meſſiah as near at hand; <hi>Balaam</hi> had ſaid, almoſt Ten A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before, <hi>I ſee him, but not nigh,</hi> which intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his coming to be then at a great diſtance. But <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks thus concerning it, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Hear now</hi> O Joſhuah <hi>the High Prieſt, thou and thy Fellows that ſit before thee, for they are men wondred at: Behold, I will bring forth my Servant the</hi> BRANCH; <hi>For behold, the Stone that I have laid before</hi> Joſhua; <hi>upon one Stone, ſhall be ſeven Eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, ſaith the Lord of Hosts, and I will remove the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Land in one day. In that day ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, ſhall ye call every man his Neighbour, under the Vine and under the Figtree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Malachy</hi> expreſſes himſelf, concerning the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching coming of the Meſſiah, thus, (<hi>Chap.</hi> III. <hi>verſe</hi> 1.) <hi>Behold, I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46528:207"/>ſhall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, behold he ſhall come ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ought to obſerve two very conſiderable things in this Prophecy: The firſt, That the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to come ſuddainly. The ſecond, That <hi>Malachy</hi> expreſly points to us, that the appearing of the Meſſiah was to be during the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the words of the Prophecy diſtinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it.</p>
                     <p>And ſure it is, that all who gave any credit to theſe Oracles, did underſtand them ſo.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, Both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> looked for the Meſſiah during the ſecond Temple. We find a paſſage expreſs to the purpoſe in <hi>Tacitus;</hi> and it was on this ground that <hi>Joſephus</hi> gave the Title of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They expected him at the end of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Weeks, which was the Third Year after the Death of Jeſus Chriſt. This was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being deluded by ſo many falſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's about the time of our Saviour, and a little after.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They never deſpair'd of his coming (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Promiſe of the Meſſiah's coming to be conditional, when as indeed it was abſolute) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they began to believe that the term ſet down by God himſelf was expired.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The reaſon of their curſing thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the times ſet down ſo diſtinctly and preciſely by <hi>Daniel,</hi> was, becauſe they found themſelves diſappointed in his Calculation, finding that the time which <hi>Daniel</hi> had pointed at for the coming
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46528:207"/>of the Meſſiah, ſeem'd to be already expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. 'Tis but of late that they have try'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it, by maintaining that the Temple will be built a third time, and that then the Meſſiah ſhall appear; but this evaſion is unanſwerably refuted: 1. Becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> aſſigns a certain term which is expired 1600 Years ſince. 2. Becauſe he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, That the deſolation of the Temple was to be for ever, as will appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters. And 3dly, Becauſe <hi>Haggai</hi> in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect calls the Temple of which he ſpeaks, <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third Houſe,</hi> by which expreſſion he ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly points out the ſecond Temple to us, that it would be ridiculous to ſuppoſe it meant, of a third Temple, to be built 1700 Years after the ruin of that of which he prophecied.</p>

                     <p>HItherto we have ſeen that the Meſſiah was to be born of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> of that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of that of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> by <hi>Juda.</hi> This hath been ſufficiently made out already.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo ſhew'd from the Oracle in the I <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> VII. That he was to be born of the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46528:208"/>of <hi>David;</hi> and we find the ſame very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and fully ſet down in the LXXXIX <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The following Prophets have expreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> XI. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> hath purſued the ſame Idea's, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Neither do the Prophets only diſtinguiſh the Meſſiah by his being born of a Virgin, but alſo by determining that Virgin to the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Neither need I repeat here what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerv'd, That this is a Truth, the Grounds whereof God had laid down in his firſt promiſe, <hi>viz. The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head:</hi> where he makes mention of the Seed of the Woman only, without naming that of the Man, the word of <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Posterity</hi> very evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigning a Man to be born of the Woman, which is acknowledg'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> in another Prophecy, and the ſame which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of as a Maxim generally owned by the Doctors of the Synagogue.
<note place="margin">Galat. III.</note> It is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the word <hi>Woman</hi> plainly denotes the Sex of which this perſon was immediately to be born.</p>
                     <p>It was obvious to judge, That ſomething mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous was to attend the Birth of the Meſſiah. We ſee <hi>Iſaac</hi> born of a barren Mother, paſt the Age of Child-bearing: We find alſo ſomething very ſingular at the Birth of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> and 'tis well known that the promiſe of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was ſomething far greater than the Birth of theſe now mentioned, how illuſtrious ſoever they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46528:208"/>might be; and that therefore probably his Birth was to be attended by a greater Miracle. But becauſe this was a thing wholly new, we ought to obſerve in what manner God did particularly foretel it.</p>
                     <p>The Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth it thus, <hi>Chap.</hi> VII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Lord ſpake again unto</hi> Ahaz, <hi>ſaying; Ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. But</hi> Ahaz <hi>ſaid, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And he ſaid, hear ye now O houſe of</hi> David, <hi>is it a ſmall thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God alſo? Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign; behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name</hi> Immanuel. <hi>Butter and honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the Evil, and chooſe the Good: for before the Child ſhall know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Evil, and chooſe the Good, the Land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings. The Lord ſhall bring upon thee, upon thy People, and upon thy Father's Houſe, days that have not come from the day that</hi> Ephraim <hi>departed from</hi> Juda, <hi>even the King of</hi> Aſſyria. Where we may obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Promiſe here is made to a wicked King, but of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> to whom the Prophet particularly addreſſes himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this Prophecy was given at a juncture of time very capable of awakening their attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, at a time when the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> was reduced to the greateſt extremity, and the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> in particular in a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Prophecy was utter'd by a very illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46528:209"/>Prophet, who was of the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It was ſealed and confirmed with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Birth of a Child, which came to paſs accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is ſet forth as a very extraordinary ſign, inſtead of that which the wicked King refuſed to ask, when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> offer'd it him, in the Name of God.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that this Character of being born of a Virgin belongs to the Meſſiah: but it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to confute them.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, Would it not have been ridiculous for the Apoſtles to go about to apply this Oracle to their Meſſiah, if it had not been a thing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally own'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> that this was the meaning of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy? Is it not evident that this Character, ſo difficult to gain belief, would rather perplex than ſtrengthen their proofs. And yet certain it is that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> has done ſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>verſe</hi> 23. as likewiſe St. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> I. <hi>verſe</hi> 31.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> obſerv'd, That the Notion of this Oracle, as we underſtand it, hath been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd amongſt the Heathens, who built their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Perſeus</hi> upon it, whom they pretend to have been born of a Virgin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It appears that all thoſe Laws which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my Reflexions upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the following Books, <hi>Chap.</hi> XX. and which have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the diſtinct knowledge of the ſtate of Virginity, receive much light from this Notion; and are without it altogether uſeleſs.</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:46528:209"/>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis evident that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not diſpute this Character, till after they ſaw that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians apply'd it to Jeſus Chriſt; and thereupon have fallen upon ſuch childiſh Fancies as may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover them with Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall be yet further ſatisfied hereof, if we add to all theſe juſt Prejudices, only the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reflexions on the terms the Prophet makes uſe of.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That the LXX Interpreters have in tranſlating this Prophecy, made uſe of a word that ſignifies a Virgin, and not a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the <hi>Jews</hi> have underſtood it ſince our Saviour's time. The firſt who rejected the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> was <hi>Symmachus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Dialog. cum <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon. Tertull.</hi> cont. <hi>Jud.</hi> cap. 9.</note> who lived in the ſecond Century, as it is obſerved by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who for this reaſon accuſe the <hi>Jews</hi> of having falſified the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word expreſly ſignifies ſuch an one, as according to the Law of Virgins, was kept under Lock and Key from the Eyes of Men, according to the cuſtom of the Eaſtern Nations, and eſpecially of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which continues amongſt them till this day.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That this word hath been taken by the <hi>Africans</hi> in the ſame ſignification, as St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> obſerves.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That the Prophet doth ſet forth this Child-bearing as a Prodigy and Miracle alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unheard of, and as a particular Character, by which the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was to be ſtrongly confirmed in the hope of ſeeing the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Promiſe which God had made of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46528:210"/>ſetling an eternal Kingdom upon it, which could not be accompliſhed but by means of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is, That tho' ſome <hi>Jews</hi> have applyed this Prophecy to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Raſchi</hi> in h. l.</note> which yet to others of them ſeems very ridiculous, he being Nine years of Age when the Prophecy was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and themſelves never making uſe of this Evaſion, except in their Diſputes againſt the Chriſtians, and ſo on this occaſion have dropt a Confeſſion which alone was ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them. Yet it hath been a thing ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received amongſt them, That this Prophecy did reſpect the Meſſiah, that after they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> one of their moſt famous Doctors concludes,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gemar</hi> in <hi>Sanhed.</hi> Cap. Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech.</note> That they ought to look for no Meſſiah, ſince the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that Prophecy having had its accompliſhment in him; an Opinion which thoſe that ſucceeded him have rejected with the greateſt abhorrence.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth is, That the Title of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> given to this Son, whoſe Birth is here promiſed, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. as the Name of him who was Lord of the Land, which is a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Heir promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> to whom <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>O God, thy God hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows.</hi> Pſal. XLV. 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh is; That the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alledged and cited two Witneſſes, <hi>Uriah</hi> the Son of <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> a Prophet, who was put to death by <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeberechiah;</hi> the former of which lived long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the latter ſince the Captivity, under
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46528:210"/>
                        <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> according to the account the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves give of them, he ſufficiently hints by this Circumſtance, That the Prophecy concerning the Birth of the <hi>Immanuel</hi> he ſpeaks of, was to be fulfill'd many Ages after, and not in that Age wherein he prophecies.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>GOD had not only pointed out the time in which the Meſſiah was to appear, with the miraculous Manner and Circumſtances of his Birth; but he had alſo named the Family, the Place, with the State and Condition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in which he was to be born, as a triple Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by which he might be known.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, firſt, That according to the Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the Meſſiah was to be born of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>David,</hi> as will appear if we conſider the following Oracles.</p>

And <hi>Zachariah</hi> in his Song of Praiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> I. <hi>verſe</hi> 69. applying it to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, puts the Matter out of all doubt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Jews</hi> are, and have always been firm in this perſwaſion, grounded on the foreſaid and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like places of Scripture, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly refer to the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:46528:211"/>
                     <p>I ſay in the ſecond place, That the Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles expreſly point out <hi>Bethlehem</hi> for the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of the Meſſiah. <hi>Micah</hi> the V. <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. <hi>But thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>though thou be little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thouſands of</hi> Judah, <hi>yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from the days of Eternity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge that this Oracle ſpeaks of the Meſſiah; and indeed the Prophet diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing by <hi>Bethlehem</hi> adding the word <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah</hi> (whence the Family of <hi>David</hi> was) from that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> which belonged to another Tribe, makes it apparent that nothing could be ſpoke more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to determine the Birth-place of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. Beſides, we find that all the Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies and Prieſts agree in this, That the Meſſiah was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> when being conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Herod</hi> about this Matter, they declared this to be their Senſe, grounded upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place of <hi>Micah, Matthew</hi> II. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, it appears that the Meſſiah was to be born in an abject, contemptible, and weak condition, and very different from the greatneſs of the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> Indeed, ſhould we only have our eye on II <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> VII. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> CXXXII. it would be natural enough to think the contrary; but <hi>Micah</hi>'s Oracle ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently refutes them; for how great things ſoever the Prophet there ſpeaks of the Meſſiah, whether as to his Divine Nature, by declaring that his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth were from the days of Eternity;</hi> or to the Majeſty and Glory of his Empire; yet however
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46528:212"/>he gives us a different Idea, inducing us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, as of one that was to be born in the ſtate of a private Perſon; for why elſe is his Birth determined, not to <hi>Zion,</hi> which was the Place and Seat of the Empire of <hi>Judah,</hi> but to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a Town where the Family of <hi>David</hi> lived, whilſt they were private Perſons, except for this cauſe, to make us conceive that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was not to be born in that place where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David</hi> poſſeſſed the Empire: but in a Condition far diſtant from the Glory of Kings, and in a place where the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was contemptible, and of very ſmall eſteem.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is hinted to us by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in his XI <hi>Chapter, v.</hi> 1. where he calls the Meſſiah <hi>a Rod,</hi> or ſhoot <hi>of the ſtem of</hi> Jeſſe. Now <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was not King, but a private Perſon. And on the ſame account it is that the Prophet deſcribes him, <hi>Chap.</hi> LIII. as having <hi>no form or comlineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> IX. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. repreſents him, not as King, ſitting on the Throne in <hi>Zion;</hi> but as riding to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on an Aſs; and he gives him the Title of <hi>Lowly,</hi> which ſignifies as well a mean Condition, as the vertue of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>But in ſhort, this is very conſiderable; 1. That thoſe who acknowledged Jeſus to be the Meſſiah, thought they had the greateſt reaſon ſo to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledged him to be the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That thoſe who deny'd him that Title, thought themſelves ſufficiently juſtified in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by eſteeming him a <hi>Nazarene;</hi> as concluding he could not be the Son of <hi>David,</hi> if he were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46528:212"/>born at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as they ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Evangeliſts preciſely tell us, That Chriſt was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi> reduced to a very obſcure Condition; and ſo making this one of the chief Characters which ſpoke him to be the Meſſiah.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the Meſſiah was to work great Miracles, for the eſtabliſhing of his Miſſion, and of the Truth of his Doctrine.</head>
                     <p>HEre is another Character which is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and whereby the Meſſiah might be certainly known, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was to work great Miracles for the confirmation of his Miſſion and of his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>This appears, as I have already hinted, 1. From the conformity which the Meſſiah was to have with <hi>Moſes,</hi> in being the Founder of a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society, and in propoſing a new Doctrine to Men; upon which account there lay upon him the ſame Obligation, as upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſupport his Authority by Miracles, that even in this he might not be inferiour to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. One may gather this alſo from the Title of <hi>Prophet,</hi> and <hi>great Prophet,</hi> which are applicable to the Meſſiah; it being difficult to conceive, That God who vouchſafed the Glory of doing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46528:213"/>Miracles to moſt of the Prophets, tho' they were barely ſent to foretel the Coming of the Meſſiah, and to give an account of him, ſhould have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Glory and the ſame Power to the Meſſiah himſelf, of whom all the Prophets were but the Forerunners.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it is eaſie to judge from the mean and contemptible ſtate wherein the Meſſiah was to appear, That this Glory of doing Miracles was of abſolute neceſſity to give him Authority and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: for ſince he was to be born in an obſcure Condition, and not in Royal Grandeur, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Gift of Miracles was needful to make him known, and counterbalance that low and opprobrious Condition in which he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the World.</p>
                     <p>But this particularly appears from an expreſs Oracle which God gave upon this very Subject, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> XXXV. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5, <hi>and</hi> 6. <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them of a fearful heart, be ſtrong, fear not; behold your God will come with vengeance, even God with a Recompence; he will come and ſave you. Then the eyes of the Blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the Deaf ſhall be unstopped. Then ſhall the Lame man leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the Dumb ſing: for in the Wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the Deſert.</hi> Which Oracle very fully expreſſes the Power of Miracles wherewith our Saviour was to be dignified, in curing all manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, of which the Prophet hath named ſome only, to give us a <hi>Specimen</hi> of the reſt; and it ſeems as if the Prophet had choſen theſe four ſorts before all others, becauſe throughout the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46528:213"/>we do not find that ever any Prophet did the like, that ſo the Character of the Meſſiah might be particular in his Miracles too.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo worth our noting, in giving a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Meſſiah, Firſt, That even thoſe who rejected Jeſus Chriſt, yet did at the ſame time ſuppoſe that the Meſſiah when he came, was to work Miracles. Therefore it is that we hear ſome of them ſaying to Chriſt, <hi>What ſign doſt thou?</hi> and others maintaining that <hi>Moſes</hi> had wrought greater Wonders than Jeſus Chriſt, in giving them Bread from Heaven, and feeding them miraculouſly for the ſpace of Forty Years; whilſt others affirm'd, That none could work greater Wonders than he wrought: <hi>When the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſhall come, will he do greater Wonders than this Man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, One ought to obſerve that Jeſus Chriſt alledges this Oracle of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> taking it for granted that the accompliſhment thereof was moſt viſibly evident in the Miracles which he wrought, as appears from the Anſwer he gave to the Meſſengers of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is alſo obſervable, That thoſe who were willing to flatter the vanity of the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> (whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> endeavoured to raiſe to a belief that he was the Meſſiah, becauſe he had been proclaimed in the Eaſt, applying to that purpoſe the words of <hi>Micah,</hi> miſapplyed, <hi>Chap.</hi> V. <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Whoſe goings forth are from the East</hi>) were not wanting to attribute to him the Glory of doing Miracles, and ſuch as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> aſcribes to the Meſſiah, by attributing to him the cure of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46528:214"/>one that was Blind, and another that was Lame at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He that would know the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, may conſult <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>And laſt of all we ought to obſerve, That the <hi>Jews</hi> do not only agree that this Oracle of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> refers to the Meſſiah; but they alſo ſtill propoſe the Power of working Miracles, as a Character which would render the Meſſiah very illuſtrious, and certainly known.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the Meſſiah was to be an illuſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</head>
                     <p>THis Truth I have already aſſerted in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions I made on the Prophecy of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> XVIII. But one ought to explain this Character of the Meſſiah more particularly, God having been pleaſed further to illuſtrate this Oracle of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, We ſay that the word Meſſiah im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Anointing, which was common to Kings, Prophets, and Prieſts; and ſince <hi>David</hi>'s time, we find nothing more common than this Title in the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>Moſes</hi> was dignified with this Gift of Prophecy; and that <hi>Samuel</hi> communicated the ſame to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when he anointed them
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46528:214"/>to be Kings. Yea, the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day are of opinion, that <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet ſhall anoint the Meſſiah; that is, initiate him in his Prophetical, as well as his Royal Function.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God more preciſely ſignifies this, <hi>Iſai.</hi> XI. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1, 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. where he declares he would communicate all the neceſſary Gifts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Function to the Meſſiah. <hi>There ſhall come forth a Rod out of the ſtem of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and a branch ſhall grow out of his Roots. And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord. So that he ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprove after the hearing of his ears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words need no Commentary: For the <hi>Jews</hi> refer them conſtantly to the Meſſiah, and they plainly import that he was to be a great Prophet, foraſmuch as all the <hi>Characters</hi> which are there given to the Spirit which was to reſt on the Meſſiah, are the ſame which in the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> we find attributed to the Prophets, and may eaſily be taken notice of in the Hiſtory of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, eſpecially of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And much to the ſame purpoſe is that paſſage <hi>Iſai.</hi> XLII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth Judgment to the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoking Flax ſhall he not quench; he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto Truth. He ſhall not fail nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged till he have ſet Judgment in the Earth, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46528:215"/>the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law. Thus ſaith God the Lord, he that created the Heavens, and ſtretched them out; he that ſpread forth the Earth, and that which cometh out of it: he that giveth breath to the People upon it, and ſpirit to them that walk therein. I the Lord have called thee in Righteouſneſs, and will hold thine, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people, for a Light of the</hi> Gentiles: <hi>to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs, out of the priſon houſe.</hi> In which Oracle one ought to take notice particularly of thoſe things which the <hi>Jews</hi> apply to the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God propoſes the Gifts of the Spirit, which he beſtowed upon him as an Effect of his Love, and the choice he had made of him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Meſſiah was to make uſe of the ſame, as Rules for reforming the Country, and propounding Gods Covenant to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which clearly ſuppoſe the neceſſity of the Gift of Prophecy to qualifie him for ſuch great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That contrary to the thundring Character which diſtinguiſhed the reſt of the Prophets, who were as ſo many publick Cenſors; the Meſſiah was to ſpeak with all meekneſs and ſweetneſs to the Nations which ſhould receive his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> repeats the ſame Idea's, <hi>Chap.</hi> LXI. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind-up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46528:215"/>to them that are bound. To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of Vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn: to appoint unto them that mourn in</hi> Zion, <hi>to give unto them Beauty for Aſhes, the Oyl of Joy for Mourning, the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſs; that they might be called Trees of Righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. And they ſhall build the old Wasts, they ſhall raiſe up the former Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they ſhall repair the waſte Cities, the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of many Generations. And strangers ſhall ſtand and feed your flocks, and the ſons of the Alien ſhall be your Plowmen, and your Vine dreſſers. But ye ſhall be named the Prieſts of the Lord, men ſhall call you the Miniſters of our God: ye ſhall eat the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and in their glory ſhall ye boaſt your ſelves. For your ſhame ye ſhall have double, and for confuſion they ſhall rejoyce in their portion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their Land they ſhall poſſeſs the double; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting joy ſhall be upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, he repreſents in this and the former Oracle, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as a People being in darkneſs, and in the miſery of a Priſon; from whence we may eaſily infer, Firſt, That the Meſſiah was to be a Prophet, how vile and abject ſoever that Character might appear in the eyes of the World, as I have ſhewed that it was, where I ſpake of the Prophets in general. Secondly, That he was to diſcharge theſe Functions during the whole courſe of his Life, and that it was to be his chief Employment here upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> had before ſignified, <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. <hi>verſe</hi> 22. that the Meſſiah was to <hi>declare the Name of God unto his Brethren,</hi> viz. the <hi>Jews,</hi> by exerciſing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46528:216"/>his Prophetical Function in <hi>Judea;</hi> but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit did ſomething more when he ſeem'd to point out <hi>Galilee</hi> as the place where this Sacred Doctor was chiefly to fix his abode.</p>
                     <p>This is in effect inſinuated, when God tells us that he was to begin his Miniſterial Functions in the Tribes of <hi>Naphtali</hi> and <hi>Zebulon. Iſai.</hi> IX. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, and 3. <hi>Nevertheleſs the dimneſs ſhall not be ſuch as was in her vexation, when at the firſt he lightly afflicted the Land of</hi> Zebulon, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Naphtali, <hi>and afterwards did more grievouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict her by the way of the Sea, beyond</hi> Jordan <hi>in Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee of the Nations. The people that walked in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have ſeen a great light, they that dwell in the land of the ſhadow of Death, upon them hath the light ſhined. Thou haſt multiplyed the Nation, thou haſt encreaſed the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in Harvest, and as men rejoyce when they divide the ſpoil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall afterwards take notice, That the time of the Meſſiah was to be diſtinguiſhed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible abundance of Spiritual Gifts: and ſo this ſhall ſuffice at preſent to prove that the Meſſiah was to be a very great Prophet.</p>

                     <p>But beſides, God directly promiſeth this new Covenant by <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> XLII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in Righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the People, for a Light of the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>To open the blind eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon, and them that ſit in Darkneſs from the Priſon houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is natural to obſerve, That in this place, where God ſpeaks of the Meſſiah, as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves confeſs, he expreſly declares two things: 1. That the Meſſiah ſhould be a Covenant of the People, that is, that he ſhould mediate a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the People. 2. That the fruit of this Covenant was to extend to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which plainly implyes that it was not the old Covenant, foraſmuch as from it ſeveral were excluded.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Covenant is alſo mention'd, <hi>Chap.</hi> XLIX. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time have I heard thee, and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee, and I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the People, to establiſh the Earth, to cauſe to inherit the deſolate Heritages.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is as clear as the day, That God in theſe Oracles promiſeth an irrevocable Covenant, becauſe he calls it an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant</hi> in oppoſition to the former. He takes notice alſo in the ſame Book, That the ſaid Covenant was to be propounded in the midſt of the Nations, and that then that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God ſhould be known according to the ancient Oracles, which was promiſed univerſally to all Nations.</p>
                     <p>This is that which God more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains afterwards, by the voice and pen of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet who was of the order of Prieſts, thereby to prevent all ſorts of Exceptions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in effect ſpeaks to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXI. <hi>verſ.</hi> 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the houſe of</hi> Judah: <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>(which my Covenant they brake, altho' I were a husband to them, ſaith the Lord:) But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after thoſe days ſaith the Lord; I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their heart, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour ſaying, know the Lord;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46528:218"/>for they ſhall all know me from the least of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more. Thus ſaith the Lord which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the Moon and Stars for a light by night, which divideth the Sea when the waves thereof roar, the Lord of Hosts is his name. If thoſe Ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a Nation before me for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be deſired more particular than this Oracle; 1. It tells us that God would make a new Covenant with his People, which ſuppoſes an aboliſhing of the former. 2. That this Covenant was not to be like the foregoing. 3. That the old Covenant had been made vain, and had been broken by thoſe with whom it was made. 4. That this Covenant was to be made <hi>after thoſe days,</hi> that is in the time of the Meſſiah. 5. That this new Covenant was not to be engraven in Tables of Stone, but in their Hearts. 6. That in the ſame Covenant full Remiſſion of Sin is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thing is alſo expreſſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> L. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>They ſhall ask the way to</hi> Zion <hi>with their faces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, ſaying, Come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant, that ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi>

                     <p>To this purpoſe alſo <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who himſelf was a Prieſt, ſpeaks of a Religious Worſhip extended

And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is firſt, a Covenant differing from the former. 2.

                        <hi>That the</hi> Jews, <hi>by a dreadful effect of their blindneſs, were to reject the Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is a very peculiar Mark which will guide us ſurely to the knowledge of the Meſſiah. We find the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day very ready to follow every one that uſurps that Auguſt Title, and to take him for the only true Meſſiah that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them; which is no other than what was infallibly to come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>Neither will this much ſurprize us, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. That this People, on divers occaſions, have given very ſtrange inſtances of a prodigious blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: We ſee them reject <hi>Moſes,</hi> notwithſtanding God had authoriz'd his Call by great and avowed Miracles. Yea, we find them rejecting <hi>David</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whom God had ſo ſignally appointed to be their King, and the Father of the Meſſiah, of whom we hear theſe Prophecies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God upbraids them with this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his Prophets, as a ſin to which they were peculiarly inclin'd; as appears from <hi>Pſalm</hi> LXIX. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28. <hi>Let their eyes be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they ſee not, and make their Loins continually to ſhake. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation be deſolate, and let none dwell in their Tents: for they perſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and they talk to the grief of thoſe whom thou haſt wounded.

                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's the ſame thing in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. VI. verſ. 9, 10, 11, and 12. where the Spirit of God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould ſhut their eyes againſt the moſt evident and convincing proofs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the Prophet, <hi>and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart and convert, and be healed. Then ſaid I, Lord how long? And he anſwered, untill the Cities be waſted without inhabitant, and the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without man, and the Land be utterly deſolate: and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forſaking in the midſt of the Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be imagined more particular than this Oracle concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> reſiſting the Prophet, which God expreſſes in terms very uſual amongſt the Prophets, as if <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the foreteller of their being hardned, ſhould himſelf be the cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi> deſcribes the very ſame Complaints of God againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for their blindneſs and ignorance, for which he denounces their deſtruction. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> IV. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for the Lord has a controverſie with the inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the Land. By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing adultery, they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46528:220"/>break out, and blood toucheth blood. Therefore ſhall the Land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh, with the Beaſts of the Field, and with the Fowls of Heaven, yea the Fiſhes of the Sea alſo ſhall be taken away. Yet let no man strive or reprove another; for thy people are as they that strive with the Prieſt. Therefore ſhalt thou fall in the day, and the Prophet alſo ſhall fall with thee in the night, and I will deſtroy thy Mother. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; becauſe thou haſt rejected knowledge I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me; ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the Law of thy God, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo forget thy children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> V. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22, and 23. <hi>Hear now this O fooliſh people, and without understanding, which have eyes and ſee not, which have ears and hear not. Fear ye not me ſaith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my preſence, who have placed the Sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetual decree that it cannot paſs it, and tho' the waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet can they not prevail; tho' they roar, yet can they not paſs over it? But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</hi> And he reiterates the ſame, <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the Turtle and the Crane and the Swallow, obſerve the time of their coming: but my people know not the Judgment of the Lord.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Neither do the Prophets only repreſent to us in general the blindneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions, but they alſo very particularly inform us, that he who was the moſt conſiderable perſon of their State, and the great Miniſter of God, ſhould be notwithſtanding rejected by them.</p>
                     <p>And here, firſt, It is worth our noting that <hi>Moſes</hi> threatens the worſt of Calamities to thoſe who ſhould refuſe to hear the great Prophet, like unto him whom God was to raiſe to his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> CXVIII. <hi>v.</hi> 22. expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this in theſe words, <hi>The Stone which the Builders refuſed is become the Head of the Corner.</hi> From which words it is evident, 1.

That this was to be before he ſhould be acknowledged the great Miniſter of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>God ſpeaks the ſame thing by <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Behold, I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation, he that believeth ſhall not make haſte.</hi> Which place is to be underſtood of the Meſſiah by the Confeſſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                     <p>On all which Prophecies we may make theſe Remarks; 1. That Jeſus Chriſt quotes moſt of them, as ſuch which by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were owned to refer to the Meſſiah. Thus <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. <hi>verſe</hi> 42. he ſaith, <hi>Did ye never read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Stone which the Builders rejected, the ſame is become the Head of the Corner.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> IV. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the ſame alluſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> II. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>And are built on the foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone.</hi> And I <hi>Cor.</hi> III. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith to <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> XVI. <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to that of <hi>Daniel; Then was the Iron, the Clay, the Braſs, the Silver, and the Gold broken to pieces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and became like the Chaff of the Summer threſhing floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the</hi> Stone <hi>which ſmote the Image became a great Mountain, and filled the whole Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Saviour applyes alſo to the <hi>Jews</hi> thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which foretel their being offended at the Miniſters of Heaven, in particular that of <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> VI. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Go and tell this people, hear ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not.</hi>

                     <p>Now it is certain that both ancient and modern <hi>Jews</hi> interpret theſe places of the Meſſiah; and it is as evident that the Apoſtles underſtood them ſo; and therefore all along applyed them to Jeſus Chriſt, following therein the known explications of the Rabbies of their own Nation.</p>
                     <p>It is plain alſo, That the Death and Suffering of our Saviour would have prov'd a more efficaci ous Argument to refute the Apoſtles, than all the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt could have been to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Doctrine, if the Prophetical Writings had not ſo preciſely determined his Sufferings and Death, with the ſeveral Circumſtances of them.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo to be noted, That the Prophecies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the Death of the Meſſiah, are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interwoven with Idea's which point to other Prophetical paſſages avowedly owned by the <hi>Jews</hi> to have Relation to the Meſſiah. Thus if we compare <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. <hi>verſe</hi> 28. with <hi>Pſalm</hi> LXXII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. we ſhall find the ſame Idea ſet forth in them both.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe this Character was to be the moſt proper and diſtinguiſhing note of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, foraſmuch as none with pleaſure do preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate themſelves into Death, or are Maſters of the Manner and Circumſtances of it, therefore God cauſed the ſame to be expreſſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with the greateſt plainneſs and exactneſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>It can't be denied but that ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46528:223"/>have been very cruelly perſecuted, and that ſome of them have died in the midſt of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But concerning the Death of Chriſt, we have many more particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1.

I ſink in deep mire, where there is no ſtanding; I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. I am weary of my crying, my throat is dried, mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. They that hate me without cauſe are more than the hairs of my head, they that would deſtroy me, being my Enemies wrongfully, are mighty.</hi>

                     <p>The ſame is repreſented to us <hi>Iſaiah</hi> LIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our ſorrows; yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.

He was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearer, is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth.

                     <p>We may make theſe following Reflexions on the foregoing Oracles.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That many of theſe Paſſages that might be queſtioned whether they were particularly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Meſſiah, are joyned with ſuch hints, as can no way agree with the Prophet; that utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Thus we find that in the XXII <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:46528:225"/>there are many Expreſſions which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That moſt of theſe Prophecies are avowedly attributed to the Meſſiah by the moſt ancient Authors of the Synagogue.

                     <p>FOraſmuch as Death entred into the World by Sin, and that the Meſſiah was to take it away, we may eaſily conceive, That if the Meſſiah were according to the Divine diſpoſal, to ſubmit to Death, that he could not long continue ſubject to it. He who was to reſtore life to thoſe who were dead, could never be confin'd and impriſon'd in a Grave: and he who was ſuperiour to <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who aſcended into Heaven, becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was exalted to the right hand of God, to reign there for ever, as the Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aſſure us, ought certainly to leave his Sepulchre by a glorious Reſurrection.</p>

                     <p>And this we are poſitively aſſured of by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Oracles. <hi>Pſalm</hi> XVI. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell; neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption.

                     <p>For the better underſtanding of which paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we are to obſerve, 1. That the Meſſiah in many or moſt of them, compriſeth all Believers with himſelf, according to that Maxim of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who attribute to the Meſſiah the greateſt of all the Prophets, whatſoever God vouchſafed to any one of the Prophets; and according to this Principle Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Matth.</hi> XII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 39, 40. <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation ſeeketh after a ſign, and there ſhall no ſign be given to it, but the ſign of the Prophet</hi> Jonah. <hi>For as</hi> Jonah <hi>was three days and three nights in the Whales belly, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That upon this account the Meſſiah is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us, not as riſing again alone, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46528:226"/>all his Brethren partakers of the ſame glory; which makes the Prophets ſpeak of him, not as a ſingle perſon, but in common with others, who by him are made poſſeſſors of the ſame advantages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That moſt of theſe Texts were quoted by the Apoſtles, who in ſo doing followed the ſenſe of the whole Nation, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> II. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed, having looſed the pains of death: becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it. For</hi> David <hi>ſpeaketh concerning him; I foreſaw the Lord always before my face, for he is at my right hand that I ſhould not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad: moreover alſo my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope: becauſe thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilt thou ſuffer thy holy One to ſee Corruption. Thou haſt made known to me the ways of life: thou ſhalt make me full of joy with thy Countenance. Men and Brethren, let me freely ſpeak unto you of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37. <hi>But God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead. And he was ſeen many days of them which came up with him from</hi> Galilee <hi>to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>who are his witneſſes unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the Promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their Children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond</hi> Pſalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raiſed him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he ſaid on this wiſe, I will give you the ſure mercies of</hi> David. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith alſo in another</hi> Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46528:227"/>holy One to ſee corruption.

                     <p n="3">3. That theſe Prophecies were generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, of the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as appears from the uſe the Apoſtles made of them when they preached to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That foraſmuch as God had ordered Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to be received into the Jewiſh Communion, he ſeem'd thereby to have hinted to them, that what he had enjoyn'd them as to particulars, ought with much more reaſon to be practiced in general to all the Nations of the World, and ought alſo to be univerſally deſired.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Modern <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believ'd, that the Meſſiah ſhould lead the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:46528:233"/>to Repentance. So <hi>Kimchi, Moſes Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and many other Authors, ſince the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Opinion which the <hi>Jews</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, That the Meſſiah, as a great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was to ſubdue the Nations, proceeds only from the ſenſe of the Oppreſſion they have been, and ſtill are, under, which makes them ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire a temporal deliverance from the power of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by means of the Meſſiah: and the pompous expreſſion of ſome of the Prophets, have ſtrengthen'd this belief in them; tho' they cannot deny but that the ſame Prophetical paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do imply that the Meſſiah was to ſubject the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the way of inſtruction.</p>

                        <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>were to be rejected in the time of the Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THere are three things which make this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular very conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That it ſeems altogether oppoſite to the Deſign of God, who was entred into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the <hi>Jews,</hi> excluding all other Nations of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That nothing ever was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Scandal to the <hi>Jews</hi> than the thoughts of a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46528:233"/>poſſibility that God ſhould ever caſt off their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third is, That the Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeem'd leſs poſſible in the time of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, than at any other time: The Meſſiah being, according to their perſwaſion, to procure the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the firſt place, and before other Nations were made partakers of thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which he brought along with him.</p>
                     <p>And it was upon this Account, that God hath forgot nothing which might make thoſe Oracles that relate to the Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of the Meſſiah, very ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>The chief Priviledges which made the <hi>Jews</hi> conſider themſelves, as God's peculiar People, were theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God himſelf was in a peculiar manner their King and Soveraign; which gave <hi>Joſephus</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call their State a Theocracy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Religious Service did wholly depend upon God; who had inſtituted their Order of Prieſthood.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God had placed them in a Country by themſelves, and ſeparated them from all other Nations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God had given them the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> which gave them an infallible Reſolution in all important Caſes happening to their State; which was an evident Mark of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Direction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God gave them particular Marks of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the extraordinary Fruitfulneſs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually uſher'd in their Sabbatical Year; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which they enjoyed during their three So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46528:234"/>Feaſts; and above all, the Deliverers which he from time to time rais'd up for them, their Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Judges and Kings.</p>
                     <p>And God alſo threatned them with evils oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theſe Bleſſings; and all this is denounced againſt them ſtep by ſtep.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He declares that he would no longer be their God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he would aboliſh and reject their order of Prieſthood, which was accordingly executed by degrees.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he would turn them out of their own Country, without recovery.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That they ſhould have no more Prophets or Revelations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That he would take away from them all the Marks of his Protection. The paſſages expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe ſeveral particulars are here ſubjoyn'd, which may be eaſily rang'd under the foregoing Heads, that we may underſtand the better that God hath plainly foretold the Rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> then threatens them with a terrible Deſolation, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee with madneſs and blindneſs, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of heart: And thou ſhalt grope at Noon day, as the blind gropeth in darkneſs, and thou ſhalt not proſper in thy ways, and thou ſhalt be only oppreſſed and ſpoiled evermore, and no man ſhall ſave thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> acknowledges that God in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage foretels, not only their firſt Deſolation under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but alſo that which happened under <hi>Titus Veſpaſian.</hi> The Eagle mention'd at
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46528:234"/>the 49th: <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> being not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whom <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> XVII. repreſents under that Notion, but more particularly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> whoſe Eagles gave a literal accompliſhment to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                     <p>This makes it evident, That at the ſame time when God threatens them with their firſt Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he alſo denounces to them the laſt; and that conſequently we may apply thoſe paſſages to the ſecond Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were ſpoken of the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hoſea</hi> expreſſeth the ſame in his firſt, ſecond, and third <hi>Chapters,</hi> where he particularly fortels their being deprived of the Royal Dignity, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Prophecy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe in. his firſt, ſecond, and fifth <hi>Chapters,</hi> as alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> XXVIII. XLII, L, and LXVI. and in his XXV <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſpeaks as if no Reſtoration was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Amos</hi> repreſents the ſame thing, <hi>Chap.</hi> V. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17, and 21, 22. <hi>Therefore the Lord the God of Hoſts, the Lord ſaith thus; wailing ſhall be in all ſtreets, and they ſhall ſay in all the High-ways, Alas! alas! and they ſhall call the Husbandman to mourning, and ſuch as are skilful of Lamentation to wailing. And in all Vineyards ſhall be wailing; for I will paſs through thee ſaith the Lord. I hate, I deſpiſe your Feaſt-days; and I will not ſmell in your ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: though ye offer me Burnt-offerings and your Meat offerings, I will not accept them, neither will I regard the Peace-offerings of your fat Beaſts.</hi> Where he hints that their Deſolation ſhall be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

And after the threeſcore and two weeks ſhall</hi> MESSIAH <hi>be cut off, but not for himſelf: and the people of the Prince that ſhall come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary, and the end thereof ſhall be with a flood, and unto the end of the War Deſolations are determined.</hi> 'Tis worth our obſerving, That <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Hiſtorian a little after the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Antiq. Lib.

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks after the ſame manner, <hi>Chap.</hi> XI. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Then ſaid I, I will not feed you, that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the reſt eat, every one the fleſh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And <hi>Malachi</hi> follows theſe common Idea's, <hi>Chap.</hi> I. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, and 11. <hi>Who is there among you that ſhuts the doors for nought?

                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot conceive how any that conſider the ſucceſſion of theſe Idea's, ſo interwoven one with another, can have the leaſt doubt whether the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be rejected at the Coming of the Meſſiah, or no; eſpecially ſince the Apoſtles and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in particular have made it appear, that the Prophets ſo plainly did foretel this Truth.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the time which ſucceeded the publiſhing of theſe Prophecies, till the Coming of the Meſſiah.</head>
                     <p>THus we have ſeen an Abridgment of the moſt remarkable Oracles utter'd, either by God himſelf, or by Prophets, whom he made uſe of to declare his Deſigns. I might eaſily have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a far greater number, but I choſe rather to content my ſelf with theſe, to avoid the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the multiplicity of Citations is apt to occaſion. And I queſtion not but theſe I have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46528:236"/>mention'd, will ſuffice to give us an Idea of God's promiſe concerning the Meſſiah ſufficiently great, and enable us to make a Judgment, whether that which the Chriſtians declare to have been the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it, be ſo indeed.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, for the further clearing of this matter, I deſire the Reader to make ſome Reflexions on the whole Matter, which ſeem to me to deſerve a ſerious attention.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That God hath by degrees put an end to thoſe Diviſions that were between ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations and the <hi>Jews,</hi> founded on their hopes of the Promiſe of the Meſſiah, as the time of its accompliſhment drew near.</p>
                     <p>We hear little now of the enmity of the <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> God having placed them in the Deſert of <hi>Paran,</hi> they have indeed continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in a manner invincible, but alſo without any great communication with their Neighbour Nations.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> they had their Kingdoms on the Borders of the Holy Land, and continued there till the time of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> ſince which we find little mention made of them, as being in a manner wholly confounded with other Nations; only we meet with ſome few Memorials of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> whoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to that promiſe were the weaker of the two, as being the Poſterity of <hi>Lot</hi>'s younger Daughter.</p>
                     <p>It is worth our obſerving, That moſt of the Prophecies of <hi>David,</hi> as well as of the following Prophets, which thunder forth ſuch terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations againſt the pride of thoſe people,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46528:236"/>threatning them with the Curſe of God and final Deſtruction, ſeem to have an eye to the old quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and jealouſie, their State quarrel which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened afterwards, ſucceeding to this their firſt Averſion, and hatred of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The State and Government of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> as well as their jealouſie againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> continued till after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who granted them the Liberty of returning to their own Country, as well as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had been carried away Captives with them by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> but contrary to the hope they had of being re-eſtabliſhed to their former Eſtate, we find, that according to the Prophecy of <hi>Malachy,</hi> they continued in Bondage to their Neighbours, yea to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, until <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Edomite</hi> poſſeſſing himſelf of the Throne of <hi>Judea,</hi> was probably flattered by thoſe of his own Nation, and by ſome <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, into a belief of his being the promiſed Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo take notice, That the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſeems to have continued this people ſo long, on purpoſe that the Spirit of Jealouſie, which was between them and the <hi>Jews,</hi> might preſerve the Notion of the promiſed Meſſiah more freſh and lively, and to engage men to a more attentive conſideration of the Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; and that God by confounding them afterwards with other Nations, intended wholly to take away their pretenſions, the Service which before they rendred to the Jewiſh Church, being no longer needful, after ſo clear and diſtinct a Revelation.</p>
                     <p>This Reflexion will be owned to be more than a Conjecture, if we conſider God's dealing with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46528:237"/>the Ten Tribes: God ſuffers them to be carried away Captives by <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> leaving only the Tribes of <hi>Judah, Levi,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Depoſitaries of the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That as it appears that God hath kept ſome diſtance of time in his Revelation, that the authority of the Prophets might be fully and firmly eſtabliſhed, which, as I have obſerved, was done by the accompliſhment of ſome Prophecies, reſpecting ſome particular Matters of Fact near at hand; ſo it pleaſed God for above Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, to leave the <hi>Jews</hi> without the light of Prophecy; becauſe that which he had given them till <hi>Malachy</hi>'s time, was ſufficient to make them know the Meſſiah, when he ſhould appear in the World.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That this Ceſſation of the Gifts of Prophecy among the <hi>Jews,</hi> did ſerve to increaſe their deſires for the Coming of the Meſſiah, in whoſe days thoſe Gifts (which were the peculiar Glory of their Nation) were to be reſtored in far greater abundance, than had ever been granted to them before.</p>
                     <p>A fourth Reflexion which is well worth our attentive conſideration, is, That God ſo ordered it in his Providence, that all the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> were tranſlated into the <hi>Greek</hi> about One hundred years after <hi>Malachy,</hi> that they might be communicated to all Nations, the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue being at that time, and indeed ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, a Language the moſt known and generally ſpoken in the World, he having with his power carried it into the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:46528:237"/>
                     <p>It is natural to conceive, that the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hereby deſigned theſe Three things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To eſtabliſh and confirm the Authority of thoſe Divine Oracles, by delivering them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Heathen, by the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Jewiſh Nation, at the deſire of a King of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, To prevent cavilling about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe Oracles. Thus, for inſtance, we ſee there is no place left to diſpute the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that Prophecy, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> ſeeing the LXX Interpreters, who were <hi>Jews,</hi> have rendred it ſo themſelves, ſome Ages before any Conteſts were ſtarted about it between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third was, To prepare and diſpoſe the Heathen for receiving the Religion of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</p>
                     <p>And indeed we may eaſily comprehend, 1. That it was neceſſary that the Prophetical Writings ſhould be communicated to the Heathen, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their ready ſubmitting themſelves to the Authority of the Meſſiah, whom they knew by thoſe Characters which had been given of him. 2. That it was not fitting that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhould wholly depend on the Authority of the <hi>Jews,</hi> foraſmuch as the ſame Divine Oracles do expreſly affirm, That the Meſſiah was to be rejected by the greateſt part of them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude theſe Reflexions with a ſhort view of the State of the Common-wealth and Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, One finds that this Government ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46528:238"/>as diſtinct from all other Nations of the Earth, as ever it did before: we ſee the Honour wherewith <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great treated their High Prieſt, and that when he was appointed Arbitrator of the difference between them and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> he determin'd the Matter in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Alexander</hi> preſerved them in the Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, as they enjoyed them under the Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and in particular exempted them from paying any Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute every ſeventh year, becauſe then they did not ſow their Ground, and conſequently could not reap.</p>
                     <p>And if we find that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on a Sabbath day, the <hi>Jews</hi> making Conſcience of defending themſelves, becauſe the Law required their ceaſing from all work; from whence <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharcides</hi> an Heathen Author takes occaſion to blame their Law; if we find him carrying a great number of <hi>Jews</hi> with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet withal we find him treating them with as much kindneſs as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> themſelves, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinct places in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia</hi> for their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
                     <p>If we find that powerful Princes, ſuch as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and ſome others of his Succeſſors, broke the power of the <hi>Jews,</hi> prophaned their Temple, and forc'd great numbers of them to abjure their Religion; yet we ſee them alſo at the ſame time, giving the higheſt inſtances of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable conſtancy and courage in defence of their Law, and in enduring the moſt exquiſite Tortures; we ſee others of them, encouraged
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46528:238"/>with the love of their Country, as well as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, putting themſelves into a poſture of defence, purifying the Temple, and celebrating a Feſtival which is obſerved even at this day, and laſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining favourable Treaties at the hands of their Enemies; as may be ſeen in the Books of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> and in the Twelfth Book of <hi>Joſephus</hi> his <hi>Antiquities:</hi> yea, we find their name and glory at that time ſpread as far as <hi>Lacaedemon,</hi> with which Common-wealth they made an Alliance during the High-Prieſthood of <hi>Onias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's them after this ſo conſiderable, under the Succeſſor of <hi>Antiochus</hi> their Perſecutor, that even thoſe Kings ſue for their Alliance with great preſents.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that <hi>Ptolomy Philometor</hi> granted to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> the Son, leave to build a Temple in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the convenience of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus</hi> had carried thither; as well as for thoſe who left their Country for the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Seleucidae;</hi> for <hi>Judea</hi> being ſituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> was ordinarily the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of War between thoſe two States. 'Tis here worth our noting, That the <hi>Jews</hi> undertook the building of the Temple in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as thinking themſelves authoriz'd by that Prophecy <hi>Iſai.</hi> XIX. 24. it being a thing otherwiſe forbid by the Law.</p>
                     <p>One ſees in the ſame Prince's Reign a great conteſt between the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pre-eminence of their Temples, at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Mount <hi>Garizim,</hi> decided by him in favour of the <hi>Jews:</hi> on which occaſion the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhewed that Prince their Law, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46528:239"/>him with the Series of their Hiſtory, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the <hi>Samaritans</hi> pretenſions.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's after this, when the <hi>Jews</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Soveraignty and High-Prieſthood on <hi>Simon,</hi> that their State became ſo powerful, that under <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> his Succeſſor they were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to attacque their Enemies in <hi>Syria,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the <hi>Edomites</hi> to admit Circumciſion: <hi>Ariſtobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his Son was crowned, his Brother ſucceeded him in the Royal Dignity, and left the State in a flouriſhing condition, notwithſtanding the Civil and Foreign Wars he was engaged in.</p>
                     <p>We find afterwards, That the inteſtine Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the Succeſſors of thoſe Jewiſh Princes, did by degrees open a gap for foreign power to enter and prevail over them, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſiding with <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and made the <hi>Jews</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but without changing any thing in their Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> a while after beſtowed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judaea</hi> upon <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Edomite. Auguſtus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him uſed the <hi>Jews</hi> with the ſame Equity as <hi>Pompey</hi> before him had done, as appears from one of his Declarations publiſh'd in favour of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> recorded by <hi>Joſephus.</hi> This <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> are the ſame under whom our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was born.</p>
                     <p>It is evident therefore, That the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> has continued diſtinct from other Nations, and ſufficiently known from the time of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> until <hi>Herod.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may alſo truly aſſert, That whatever inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had, for the Idolatries of their Neighbours, yet we don't find them given that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46528:239"/>way during this interval, between the laſt of their Prophets and <hi>Herod,</hi> as if the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> had always ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Ears, <hi>Mal.</hi> IV. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Remember the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>my Servant, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's that the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> in great numbers ſuffered Martyrdom, rather than abjure their Religion; and that they obſerved the Ceremonial Law with all carefulneſs, of which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf was witneſs.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that under Strangers and Heathen Kings they exempted themſelves from anſwering any Suit at Law on the Sabbath day, from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute the ſeventh Year, and preſerving the Rights and Priviledges of their Temple in ſpight of all oppoſition. Laſtly, one finds them, during <hi>Herod</hi>'s Government, ſupported by the favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in refuſing to ſet up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Trophees, for fear leaſt ſome Images might be hid under them, which they looked upon as a Crime againſt their Law.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant, that ſince <hi>Malachy,</hi> ſome Hereſies ſprung up among the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Greeks</hi> (who applyed themſelves to Philoſophical Speculations) having contributed to make them much more Diſputacious than they were before. The Authority likewiſe of their Kings, who were High-Prieſts alſo, may have had a great ſtroke in blemiſhing the Purity of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>But yet the Diſputes which we find amongſt them, as that of the Fatality of Events, did not at all touch the Subſtance of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>They no ſooner found the Spirit of Epicuriſme
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46528:240"/>to creep in amongſt them, but they framed ſuch additions to their publick Liturgy, as they thought moſt proper to eradicate, or at leaſt condemn that Corruption.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs alſo, that the Phariſees and Doctors of their Law had greatly alter'd their Morality, in making their own Explications (by the great Authority which they had amongſt the People) to paſs for Authentick: but yet this change and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in their Morals, as to practice, did not go ſo far as to aboliſh the Laws themſelves, which were only wreſted from their true meaning. This was indeed a great Corruption, but not ſuch a one as could make it to be no more the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>So that we may boldly aſſert (which is a thing very important to our preſent purpoſe) That the State and Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> have continued ſufficiently entire till the time of the appearing of the Meſſiah in the World, for their preſerving of whatſoever was neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> as well the Books of the Old Teſtament, as the knowledge of thoſe Oracles which foretold the coming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, together with the Knowledge of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, according to which the Prophets have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their Predictions concerning him.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have ſhewn in my Reflexions upon the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That the Facts of the Creation, and the Promiſes of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, are Truths not to be queſtioned, and that the Idea's of this Meſſiah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vigorouſly all the time that preceded the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s going out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſeen afterwards in the Remarks which I have made upon the Laws which God gave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it was the great deſign of God to keep men in the expectation of this Meſſiah, and to take care that they might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know him whenever he ſhould appear in the World.</p>
                  <p>I have taken notice in the third part of theſe Reflexions of the care which God took to give a great number of Oracles to explain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly all the Characters of this Meſſiah, the Place and Manner of his Birth, the principal
<pb facs="tcp:46528:242"/>Circumſtances of his Life, Death, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to foretel the Effuſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Gentiles, their Call to the Religion of the Meſſiah, and laſtly, the overthrow of the whole Model of the Jewiſh Religion and Common-wealth, which was no longer of any uſe after the Coming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, and the Calling of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>My preſent buſineſs is now to ſhew, That in the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> we may find an exact accompliſhment of this whole Deſign, wherein God had with ſo much care inſtructed the World ſo long before, and there is nothing more eaſie, if we will but take a little pains to read theſe Books attentively, and to compare them with the Model which God himſelf made, as we have hitherto deſcribed it.</p>
                  <p>To make this Truth yet more evident, I think it will be neceſſary to do two or three things which ſeem to be very important for my preſent Deſign.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I am to obſerve that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a moſt perfect Coherence between the Idea's of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>New,</hi> which is abſolutely neceſſary to ſhew that there is in theſe Books a perfect unity of Deſign, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vaſt difference there is between the <hi>Jews</hi> who preſerve the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who preſerve the <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46528:242"/>
                  <p>Secondly, I am to demonſtrate that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's of the Meſſiah were very ſtrong in the minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the very time that Jeſus Chriſt appeared in the World.</p>
                  <p>This was abſolutely neceſſary, that they might not have wherewith to accuſe thoſe who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt for the Meſſiah, of being deceived in their choice, for not having had the exact Idea's of the Meſſiah which God had promiſed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall upon this account ſhew in the third place, That when Jeſus Chriſt did appear in the World, the Model which God had framed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby the Meſſiah might be plainly known, did then ſubſiſt in the manner wherein God had framed it.</p>
                  <p>After this I ſhall endeavour to ſhew by prooſs, which are indeed unqueſtionable, That in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all the Characters which the Prophets gave, by which the Meſſiah might be known; we cannot conceive a more exact execution of God's Deſign as to the Meſſiah, than that which we find in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, whereof the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have given us the Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I ſhall ſhew clearly that this Model which God had framed in giving the Law and in forming the Common-wealth and Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſo proper a manner, to make the Meſſiah certainly known, is not in being at this
<pb facs="tcp:46528:243"/>day; but that it was ſo deſtroyed by the total Diſperſion of that People, that we ſhould not be able to know the Meſſiah if he ſhould now appear again in the World. And that indeed the principal Events, which according to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were to follow the Coming of the Meſſiah, are already come to paſs in part, and do ſtill come to paſs every day.</p>
                  <p>I hope to evince theſe Truths beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; Indeed the bare reading of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> plainly diſcovers the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence which they have with the Books of the <hi>Old.</hi> It ſhews clearly that the Idea's of the Meſſiah were at that time very ſtrong in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it ſuppoſeth without any affectation that that Model which God had made ſo neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the Meſſiah, ſtood at that time intire.</p>
                  <p>In particular, It is certain that the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, by the Relation of unqueſtionable matters of Fact, have proved that Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is the Meſſiah which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſhews in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> that after the Reſurrection of Jeſus Christ, and the Effuſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, the Goſpel was preached to the Heathens.</p>
                  <p>The Epiſtles are a natural Conſequence of this Vocation of the Heathens, and of the aboliſhing
<pb facs="tcp:46528:243"/>of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which the Apostles had undertaken. They unanimouſly conſpire to ſhew that God had reſolved to call the Heathens to partake of Salvation, that the <hi>Jews</hi> for the greateſt part ſhould be juſtly deprived thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obſtinately rejected the Meſſiah. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Queſtions are examined, which aroſe either from the Calling of the Gentiles, or from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of the Ceremonial Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Succeſſion of the Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Church juſtifies, That after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> all People imbraced the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, in receiving him for the Meſſiah whom God had promiſed to the Patriarchs, and to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall reſume all theſe Articles one by one, in that Natural Order in which I have propoſed them.</p>

                        <hi>That there appears a very juſt Connexion bè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Idea's of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>and thoſe of the</hi> New, <hi>the latter borrowing light from the former.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS it is not much the Character of Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even then when they are moſt tyed up to the Rules of Probability, to borrow either the Stile or Idea's of thoſe Authors from whom they take their-Subject, ſo I ſuppoſe that in this my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46528:245"/>Undertaking to ſhew that the <hi>New Testament</hi> is an exact accompliſhment of the <hi>Old,</hi> it is very important to make out, that at the firſt reading of the Goſpels and Apoſtolical Writings, one finds in them a perfect conformity of Idea's, with the Writings of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One may to this purpoſe obſerve in general, That the Goſpel ſuppoſeth the Divine Authority of the Book of the Old Teſtament, as an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Truth. The Goſpels and Epiſtles have the ſame coherence with the Books of the Law and Prophets, which the Writings of the latter Prophets have with thoſe of the former, and which the Books of all the Prophets together, have with the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and with the Prophecies, Laws and Hiſtories which are contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                     <p>One may take notice afterwards, That all the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have an eſſential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe of the <hi>Old,</hi> in their moſt principal Deſigns. I have ſhewed that their deſign was no other, than to raiſe men to expectations of the Meſſiah, and to paint <hi>him</hi> to the life, whom God had promiſed from the beginning of the World; and the only deſign of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is, to prove that the Meſſiah is come according to the Prophets. The firſt ſpeaks concerning the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah as expected, the latter as already come.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt proceed to a more particular view of this matter. I ſay then firſt of all, That the Chriſtians have the ſame Object of their Faith which the <hi>Jews</hi> had; this Jeſus Chriſt himſelf declares, where he ſaith; <hi>This is life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that they might know thee the only true God, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46528:245"/>Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Behold here the true Character of the Chriſtian Religion, as well as of the Jewiſh, to believe one only God, to own a Meſſiah, and to acknowledge that Jeſus Chriſt is he. The Jews agree with us in the two former Articles, tho' they diſpute the laſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſay in the ſecond place, That the Laws of the Goſpel, which regulate Religion, and the Conduct of particular perſons in that Society, are exactly the ſame with thoſe of the old Teſtament. Jeſus Chriſt in his Sermon upon the Mount, which contains an Abridgment of his Ethicks, had no other end but to reſtore the true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Laws God had given upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and tho' in the matter of Divorces, it ſeems oppoſite to that Law wherein God had before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, yet we may eaſily conceive that he began to abrogate thoſe Orders and Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were only given to make the Meſſiah known whenever he ſhould appear.</p>
                     <p>The prayer which Jeſus Chriſt taught his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is full of Notions which reigned among the Jews, as ſeveral Expoſitors have manifeſted. I ſhall content my ſelf with alledging the inſtance of the petition for our daily Bread, which has an evident regard to the Manna which God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs for Forty years.</p>
                     <p>We know alſo that the Sacraments of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Euchariſt, are originally Jewiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which Jeſus Chriſt hath applied with a very little variation, to much more important Subjects. Baptiſm was a waſhing which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Sacrifices and Circumciſion of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46528:246"/>lites. And the waſhing practiſed under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſignified that the Proſelyte, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame, was reſolved to renounce his former Courſes, and for the time to come to follow an oppoſite way of living, according to the Rules preſcribed him by the Miniſters of Heaven, after that they in the Name of God had aſſured him of the remiſſion of his ſins.</p>
                     <p>The Euchariſt was an Appendix of the Feaſt of the Paſſover, which preſerved the Memory of the Sufferings of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance he afforded them, in puniſhing of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> This Ceremony did perpetuate the Memory of that Deliverance till the coming of the Meſſiah. Jeſus Chriſt hath ſubſtituted to this figure an inſtance of the Curſe of God againſt the Poſterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> the Idea of his Death, by which he hath communicated his Bleſſing to all Nations of the Earth according to his promiſe. And he hath made it a more full and exact Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of his Death, which he would have us to conſider as the death of the true <hi>Lamb, which takes away the ſins of the World.</hi> As the old Covenant was made in the Blood of a Lamb, ſo Jeſus Chriſt, with regard to the New Teſtament or Covenant promiſed by <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> XXXI. ordains the celebrating the Memorial of the Blood he had ſpilt, <hi>This is the New Testament in my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. And laſtly, whereas the Law ordained the Commemoration of the Paſchal Lamb but once a year, Jeſus Chriſt ſeems to appoint a much more frequent celebration of the Euchariſt, when he ſaith, <hi>As oft as ye ſhall eat this Bread,</hi> &amp;c. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which, without doubt, is taken from the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46528:246"/>greatneſs of the benefit which his death confers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                     <p>It is well worth our Obſervation, That ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the ſame Prophetical Idea's that are found in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> may be met with in the <hi>New.</hi> The Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> contains abundance of particulars ſet down in the Prophecies of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf purſues the Idea's of the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> in the XXIV of <hi>Matthew,</hi> when he ſets forth the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterwards he deſcribes the ſame according to the Notions which <hi>Daniel</hi> gives us thereof.</p>

                        <hi>Daniel</hi> foretels in the VII <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Book, the Deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy by the Chriſtians, whom he ſtiles <hi>the People of the moſt High.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> follows the ſame Notion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VI. 2. where he ſuppoſeth it as a known thing: <hi>The Saints</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall judge the World.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> in the XX of the <hi>Revelations, verſe</hi> 4. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Satan bound, and the Government put into the hands of Believers.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very remarkable, That the promiſes and threats of Jeſus Chriſt are expreſſed in terms borrowed from the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He that hears my words, and believes in him that ſent me, hath eternal life, and ſhall not come into Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. have not they a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>Adam</hi>'s unbelief and diſobedience, to the judgment he underwent, and the puniſhment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him? Is it not from this Spirit which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates both, that the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo oft makes mention of a <hi>New Canaan,</hi> a <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> a <hi>New Name,</hi> &amp;c. and that Glory is repreſented to us
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46528:247"/>ſometimes under the Notion of Paradiſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a Feaſt, where <hi>Abraham</hi> (who is called <hi>the Father of the Faithful</hi>) ſits at the upper end?</p>
                     <p>Eternal Damnation is repreſented to us under the Notion of the Valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> of a Lake burning with Fire and Brimſtone, with regard to the Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to the place where the filth of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was wont to be burnt up and conſumed. 'Tis upon this account that Believers are exhorted to <hi>remember</hi> Lot's <hi>Wife, Luke</hi> IX. 62. and XVII. 32. and to depart from the midſt of the wicked, <hi>Hebr.</hi> XIII.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Election of the Apoſtles, and of the Seventy Diſciples, we ſhall find the reference they have to the Heads of the Twelve Tribes, and to the Seventy Elders whom <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe, to preſerve the memory of the Seventy Souls <hi>Jacob</hi> brought with him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Theſe paſſages, <hi>Ye ſhall ſit on Twelve Thrones,</hi> and <hi>your Names are written in the Book of Life:</hi> and the Number of 144000, being the product of 12 times 12, by alluſion to the Twelve Tribes, do all borrow their Light from thoſe ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>Throughout the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a continual alluſion to the ſtate of the Jews; all thoſe Idea's of the <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God</hi> do allude to the Ceremony of their Jubilee. The <hi>Firſt born</hi> mentioned there, and the <hi>Kingdom of Prieſts,</hi> are not to be underſtood but by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eye on the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt be called <hi>the chief Corner Stone,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> be called <hi>a Stone or Rock,</hi> Believers <hi>living. Stones,</hi> and the Apoſtles <hi>Foundations,</hi> it is by way of alluſion to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46528:247"/>the manner in which the Twelve Princes or Heads of the Tribes did contribute towards the building of the Temple, and to the manner of the building of it. If the Children of <hi>Zebedee</hi> are called <hi>Boanerges,</hi> 'tis with reference to the ſecond of <hi>Haggai, Yet once, and I will ſhake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth.</hi> That the Heathens are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as a people <hi>afar off,</hi> and what is ſpoken concerning the <hi>Wall of Partition,</hi> hath a viſible reſpect to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> being prohibited to enter into the holy place of the Temple.</p>
                     <p>If I would inſtance in all the myſtical Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the one Volume to the other, I might ſay that there appears a ſingular conformity between them, even in thoſe things which ſeem moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt and great Miniſter of the Law, had a ſtammering ſpeech, <hi>Zachary</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of S. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was ſtruck dumb, when he was to pronounce the ſolemn Bleſſing to the people; where as Jeſus Chriſt on the contrary has this character given of him, that <hi>never man ſpake like him.</hi> God ſaid at the beginning, <hi>Encreaſe and multiply,</hi> he repeats the ſame to <hi>Noah,</hi> in order to the propagation of Mankind, and repleniſhing the Earth; Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Go and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and the Word is conſtantly repreſented to us as the Seed of the Regeneration, and Paptiſm as the Laver or waſhing whereby we acquire a new Birth. We ſee <hi>Noah</hi> receiving the Dove into the Ark with an Olive Branch, as a ſign of the peace of Heaven, and Jeſus Chriſt receives a like To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>Fire falls down from Heaven on the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel, Noah, Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:46528:248"/>as a Token that God accepted their Offerings; and God ſends the ſame Mark of his Favour on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> to declare that the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt was moſt acceptable to him.</p>
                     <p>God had forbid the High Prieſt to rend his Clothes on any occaſion whatſoever, that rending of Garments involving a Myſtery, as appears from the Hiſtory of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> and yet we ſee, that the High Prieſt rent his Cloaths at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of our Saviour, and thereby violated for ever the Authority of his Prieſthood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary we find the Garments of our Lord and Saviour were left whole and entire, to ſignifie to us the Eternity of his Prieſthood. We ſee that the Ear of <hi>Malchus</hi> the High Prieſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was cut off by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that Jeſus Chriſt reſtored it again, to ſhew that the Synagogue had loſt the true Faith, and Jeſus Chriſt alone was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſtore it. We ſee the holy place in the Temple opened at the Death of Chriſt, by the rending of the Vail, which ſignified that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law was then to loſe its force and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>But the Obſervations already made are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make out what I intend, without having recourſe to theſe Myſteries; and I believe no man can make ſuch Reflexions, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that ſo great a conformity of Idea's, muſt neceſſarily imply a perfect unity of deſign; now it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that this unity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhould be ſo conſtantly obſerved by different Authors, who lived at ſuch a diſtance of times, places, and intereſts, without being convinced of a perpetual Divine guidance.</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:46528:248"/>
                     <p>I acknowledge that in the <hi>New Testament</hi> there may be found ſome Deciſions which ſeem wholly oppoſite to thoſe of the <hi>Old:</hi> For inſtance, We find there a total abrogation of the Ceremonial Law; but foraſmuch as all thoſe Obſervations had no other uſe, but to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Jews</hi> from all other Nations of the Earth, and by this means to make the Meſſiah known to the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he was to be born; ſo it is obvious to conceive that all thoſe Ceremonies were of courſe to be aboliſhed, after that the Meſſiah was come into the World, and that if we conſider things in this view, we ſhall find no contradiction at all between <hi>Moſes,</hi> who eſtabliſhed theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and the Apoſtles who aboliſhed them.</p>
                     <p>But before we come to confirm theſe Grounds, we muſt make it appear, that the Idea's of the Meſſiah continued very freſh in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and this ſhall be the ſubject of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>That the Idea's of the Meſſiah continued very freſh in the Minds of the</hi> Jews <hi>at the time of the Coming of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT would be an eaſie matter for me here to ſhew that the Idea's of the Meſſiah were lively in the Minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the coming of Jeſus
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46528:249"/>Chriſt. This appears from the Fable which the Rabbies told <hi>Origen,</hi> concerning <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> and <hi>Ahiab,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> burnt, for perſwading the Jewiſh women, that they were the perſons that were to conceive the Meſſiah. But I intend to make uſe of proofs of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Now to prove that the Notion of the Meſſiah was very freſh in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we need only take notice, that the promiſe of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, was the firſt, the moſt important, and repeated with the greateſt aſſiduity in the Books of the Prophets, and conſequently it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them the moſt: God having for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon obliged them to read the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> every Sabbath, to ſing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Writings of the Prophets, where the promiſe of the Meſſiah was a thouſand times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
                     <p>We may add a great deal of light to this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if we conſider that the Circumſtances of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, engaged them to give more diligent heed to what the Prophets had declared; and by weighing ſeveral Matters of Fact ſet down in the Goſpel, to ſhew the Univerſal effect of the lively impreſſion of this Notion of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah on the minds of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Without doubt the Eſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, being equally oppreſt by the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that of <hi>Herod,</hi> could not but put them upon a careful examining of the promiſes, which God had ſo often vouchſafed them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meſſiah; and the rather becauſe God had often repreſented to them the Kingdom of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46528:249"/>the Meſſiah as a Temporal Kingdom, which was to deliver them from the power of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>This appears very evident in the Goſpel on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral occaſions. We find that the people of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> were troubled at the News of the Birth of Jeſus, as that which would probably cauſe great Troubles and Deſolations before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah could ſubdue the <hi>Romans</hi> as well as <hi>Herod:</hi> One ſee's that the Multitudes would have taken Chriſt and proclaimed him their King, and ſubmitted themſelves to him as the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah: One ſee's that Chriſt's own Diſciples, both before and after his Death, talked agreeably to theſe popular Idea's. What elſe can we make of that paſſage of the Mother of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when ſhe begs for them the chief places in his Kingdom? When the Apoſtles diſpute which of them ſhould be the greateſt, was it not an effect of the ſame cauſe? Did not the Apoſtles, when they went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> diſcourſe at the ſame rate? did not they expreſs themſelves with much grief and trouble, before they were inſtructed in the moſt ſublime Truths of the Goſpel? <hi>But we truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very obſervable, That <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> appears and adminiſters the Sacrament of Baptiſm at this time: This his practice gave the <hi>Jews</hi> occaſion to take him for the Meſſiah; but what ground had they to think ſo? ſurely from what they had read in <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> XXXVI. <hi>verſe</hi> 25. And indeed, when the great Councel of the <hi>Jews</hi> deputed ſome perſons to him, they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46528:250"/>charged them to know of him whether he were the Meſſiah, or no; and if not, why he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Function, which that Prophecy ſeem'd to appropriate to the Meſſiah himſelf, in calling him the Angel of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Truth may alſo be collected from what is related to us concerning the Opinions of the <hi>Jews</hi> about the Perſon of Chriſt; <hi>whom,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>do people ſay I am?</hi> And the Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſome ſaid he was <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> others <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> others <hi>Elias,</hi> and others again <hi>that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> that is to ſay the Meſſiah, who is ſo called by way of Excellence in the XVIII. of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> And we find that when Jeſus Chriſt ſtil'd himſelf <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> the Multitudes eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he alluded to the Seventh of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Meſſiah is ſo called.</p>
                     <p>We perceive alſo from many other places in the Goſpel, That the Multitudes were very well acquainted with thoſe paſſages in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which were commonly applyed to the Meſſiah: <hi>The Meſſiah, when he appears,</hi> ſay they, <hi>will he do greater ſigns than this Man doth?</hi> Others are offended becauſe Jeſus Chriſt was of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> arguing from thence that he could not be the Meſſiah: Others maintain that when the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſhould come, it would not be known whence he was; and others again aſſerted, that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to continue for ever. All which is an evident ſign that the Idea's of the Meſſiah were very familiar among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This muſt have been ſo of neceſſity, becauſe the <hi>Samaritans</hi> themſelves were poſſeſt with the ſame Idea's, tho' they had not ſo great an extent
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46528:250"/>of Light as the <hi>Jews</hi> had. They did not indeed altogether reject the Writings of the Prophets, but rather ſtudied them with care, their Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Jealouſie upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the promiſe, of the place of the Temple, and other things in queſtion, do manifeſtly ſhew that the Characters of the Meſſiah were known to them, and that they were exactly informed in that whole Matter.</p>
                     <p>One ought alſo to take notice, That as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles call that <hi>the fulneſs of time,</hi> becauſe the times ſet down by the Prophets were almoſt expired, and the Scepter was already departed from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> the Weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> were ended, and the Kingdoms of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> were overturn'd; ſo there were ſeveral good men, who were filled with an expectation of the Meſſiah. <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> are repreſented to us, as thoſe who by their ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, had diſcover'd that the time of the coming of the Meſſiah was near at hand, much in the ſame manner as <hi>Daniel</hi> is repreſented to us to have learnt from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that the Captivity was almoſt expired.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall add one Argument more which ſeems beyond exception, That many perſons were found about the time of Jeſus Chriſt, who were either drawn by others into an opinion of their being the Meſſiah, or who of themſelves deſired to be accounted ſo. Thus we are told that the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great gave him the Title of <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Of this number were <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Judas Gaulonites,</hi> with ſome others: Thus alſo ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome applyed the Prophecies concerning the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46528:251"/>Meſſiah to <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, becauſe he had been choſen in the Eaſt. This is atteſted by <hi>Joſephus, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who aſſure us, that the Notion of the promiſed Meſſiah, as of a great King, was very common in the Eaſt, and not unknown in the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>We know that under the Emperour <hi>Adrian Barchochab</hi> was the cauſe of a terrible Sedition, by making the <hi>Jews</hi> believe that he was the Meſſiah: And we cannot be ignorant how many ſuch like Impoſtors have been ſince, who have abuſed the Credulity of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rycaut.</hi> Turk. Hiſt. Vol. 2. p. 174. &amp;c.</note> even until <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> who deluded them about One and twenty years ſince.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We cannot but think that this Idea of the Meſſiah was always freſh among the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe we find that from that time they have continually diſputed with the Chriſtians about this Matter; becauſe they tell us of two Meſſiah's, one the Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the other the Son of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and becauſe in all places of the World whither they are ſcattered, they ſpeak of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah in their Commentaries on the Scriptures, in their Sermons, in their publick Prayers, and their common Converſation.</p>
                     <p>Surely if any time can be ſuppoſed, wherein they might have loſt their knowledge and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct hope of the Meſſiah, it muſt be ſince the time appointed for his coming is expired, when by the Chriſtians inſulting over their vain Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, they have been oblig'd (finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſappointed by Prophetical Calculations) to ſet up that raſh Maxim, <hi>Curſed is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the times.</hi> And therefore it is evident, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46528:251"/>theſe Notions were much more lively in them, when their hopes were well grounded, and when they might pretend to ſee them accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>It is no leſs certain, that the Model appointed by God, by means of which the Meſſiah might be certainly known, did ſtill ſubſiſt in the ſame manner as God at firſt had formed it: but that I may give a full light to this Capital Truth; I ſhall tye my ſelf to conſider the ſeveral Arguments for it diſtinctly; and ſhall begin with thoſe which ſhew that the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſubſiſt according to the Divine Model; and then proceed to others which demonſtrate, that God had therein preſerved all the Diſtinctions neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his deſign.</p>

                     <p>THere are two things which ſeem to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this Propoſition; the one is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Jewiſh State, the other is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Religion; but it is eaſie to remove both theſe Difficulties.</p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:46528:252"/>
                     <p>For, the overturning of the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not draw along with it that of the Scripture, and the Laws on which it was founded, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards governed. Wherefore the caſe of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick is not the ſame with that of <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which at preſent ſubſiſt no where, but in Books, becauſe there are no people now that follow the Laws of the ancient Legiſlators of <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But on the contrary, we find the <hi>Jews</hi> in all parts of the World, keeping theſe Laws with great carefulneſs, ſtudying them with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt application, and flattering themſelves that God will one day re-eſtabliſh them in <hi>Judea,</hi> which they expect by means of the Meſſiah, whom God at firſt promiſed to them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis now above 1600 years that they have been ſcattered throughout the World, and yet we find not that their condition has made them change their Meaſures or Hopes; and thô they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been deceived by a great number of falſe Meſſiahs, yet do not they for all that look upon the condition of their Common-wealth as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable.</p>
                     <p>Now, if during ſo long a Series of Ages, they have kept their Laws with ſo much carefulneſs, if they ſtill religiouſly obſerve all thoſe Laws which could be kept without the Bounds of the Holy Land; who ſees not but that in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they muſt have kept them more exactly at the time of Jeſus Chriſt, and before his coming, when they could keep them with much more eaſe than ſince that time, and that for many conſiderable Reaſons.</p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:46528:252"/>
                     <p>For firſt, Their Diſperſion then was in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nation, whereas now they are ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Heathens, Chriſtians, and Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They had then Prophets who exhorted them to the obſervance of theſe Laws, which now they have wanted for ſo many Ages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They had often Princes that were very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, ſuch as <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> who ordered that Sacrifices ſhould be offered for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> afterwards had the ſame inclinations for them; whereas ſince the time of their Diſperſion, they have ſcarcely met with any one Prince that has been favourable to them, if we except <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who from an effect of his hatred againſt the Chriſtians, did vainly ſtrive to re-eſtabliſh them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They had a Temple to which the whole ſtate of their Republick was fixed. <hi>Herod</hi> about the time of our Saviour had moſt magnificently repaired it, whereas now for ſo many Ages they have neither Temple nor Altar.</p>

                     <p>Since therefore we find that they without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, without King, out of their own Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have obſerved theſe Laws for ſo many Ages, notwithſtanding their diſperſion throughout all places, and amongſt all ſorts of people; how much rather may we conceive they did ſo ſince the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> who placed the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in the order in which we have them at this day? There are only 542 years, from the time of the return of their Captivity, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 3468, to the Birth of Chriſt; and but 259 years from their return, to the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 70, and we know that above 1600 years are paſt ſince their general Diſperſion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it appears that the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſo well preſerved the form of the Jewiſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time, as well as that of their Religion, that a <hi>Roman</hi> General ſent to demand a kind of permiſſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to let him paſs with the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles through <hi>Syria.</hi> We know that thoſe Eagles were never ſet up at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but it was at a time when a <hi>Roman</hi> Commander intended to ſtir up the <hi>Jews</hi> to Sedition, and by that means to make the Emperour their Enemy. Yea, we find that tho' the <hi>Romans</hi> reſerved to themſelves the power of the Sword, yet they permitred to the <hi>Jews</hi> the Judgment of Zeal, againſt thoſe whom they called Hereticks, whom they tore to pieces, to execute the rigour of the Law.</p>
                     <p>If we find that a <hi>Roman</hi> Proconſul would not concern himſelf with Queſtions of their Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing without the Bounds of their own Country, how much rather may we judge that they enjoy'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46528:253"/>an entire liberty within <hi>Judea?</hi> And indeed we find the Prieſts ſending their.
<note place="margin">Acts IX. 4.</note> Commiſſioners to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> againſt the Chriſtians, without doubt with deſign to execute the Law againſt Impoſtors. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was beaten ſeveral times with forty ſtripes ſave one, which could not be upon any other pretence, but to obey the Law in that matter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe proofs are ſufficient to make out that the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſubſiſted ſtill in the ſame manner as God inſtituted it.</p>
                     <p>And as for what concerns the overthrow of their Religion, as God had interwoven the Laws that regulated it, with thoſe of their Government, ſo that their Religion was nothing elſe but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Policy; it is evident that their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continuing at the time of Jeſus Chriſt, we cannot doubt, but that their Religion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the corruption which the Phariſees and Traditionary <hi>Jews,</hi> whom Chriſt continually cenſures, had introduced, did ſtill continue pure enough, to anſwer the Model which God had framed.</p>
                     <p>They rejected the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as appears from the IV of S. <hi>John,</hi> and looked upon them as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, having no Commerce with them.</p>
                     <p>They lived in a perfect Alienation from the Heathen; 'tis with this S. <hi>Peter</hi> begins his Diſcourſe to the Aſſembly at the Houſe of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> X. 28.</p>
                     <p>They lived in an exact Obſervance of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts which God had preſcribed them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, the Feaſt of Expiation and of Tabernacles.</p>
                     <p>They obſerved the Feaſts which their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46528:254"/>had joyn'd to theſe upon extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as that of the Dedication, that of <hi>Lots,</hi> and ſome Faſts which they kept then, as they do to this day. This appears by the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and by the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>They aſſiſted at theſe ſolemn Feſtivals with much regularity.</p>
                     <p>They did not till their Ground in the Seventh year, according to God's Command, which made the Heathen Princes which were over them, to releaſe them from paying any Tribute that year, as may be ſeen in <hi>Joſephus</hi> and other Authors.</p>
                     <p>They taught the Law in their Synagogues, and that every Sabbath day.</p>
                     <p>They were ſo ſcrupulous in their obſervation of the Sabbath, that they accuſed our Saviour for healing the Sick on that day.</p>
                     <p>It appears that Lepers were ſequeſtred, and that they obſerved the diſtinction of the ſeveral kinds of Leproſie, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find by the Hiſtory of the <hi>Gadarenes,</hi> that Swine were looked upon as unclean Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that they paid the Tribute which was appointed for the uſe of the Temple, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the re-eſtabliſhment of that Cuſtom, which we find II <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIV. 5. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that this practiſe was continued till the deſtruction of the Temple.
<note place="margin">Antiq. XVIII. Ch. XII.</note> We meet with the ſame in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and other Heathen Authors of that time.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that at the ſame time they were extreamly corrupt in their Doctrines, with which Chriſt upbraids the Phariſees and Saduces: but this corruption reſpected rather their Morals,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46528:254"/>than the Externals of their Religion; as appears plainly from hence, that Jeſus Chriſt upbraids the Phariſees with their tithing Mint and Cummin, that is, with their obſervance of outward Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whilſt they neglected the very Eſſentials of Piety.</p>
                     <p>They held that Heathens could not paſs for their Neighbours, from whence it would follow, that God did not forbid them to bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt a Heathen. Hence alſo they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it was lawful for them to kill their Enemies, and this fomented their hatred and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſity againſt all other Nations. It was on this account that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that he talked with a <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman.</p>
                     <p>Their Deciſions concerning Adultery were no leſs corrupt, which they declared to be no ſin, ſo long as it did not proceed to the outward Act; which Opinion of theirs was more groſs than that of many Heathens, who had a truer Idea of the Purity of Heart which God requires of us, as well as that of the Body. But yet this did not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtroy their Religion, tho' it obſcured the Excellency and Sublimity thereof.</p>
                     <p>As for the Saduces, beſides that their Errours were only ſpeculative, amongſt the greateſt part of them, it is certain that what the Goſpel ſaith of their denying the Exiſtence of Souls and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, muſt be underſtood with ſome qualification, as the Learned have ſolidly proved, and amongſt others Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> on the Goſpels.</p>
                     <p>And without repeating thoſe things which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur'd the preſervation of their State, and which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46528:255"/>alſo viſibly tended to the preſerving of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I ſhall only obſerve, That the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, with very little difference, are found in the ſame practices and opinions, as to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which they had at the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then, that after ſo long a time of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, we find no greater change in their Belief (though their Traditions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably encreaſed, the Rules whereof they have infinitely multiplyed, and thereby encreaſed this Corruption) how can it be imagin'd that the Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> was wholly loſt, or had no being at the time of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Let this therefore be eſtabliſhed as a certain Truth, That the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſubſiſting entirely, it was eaſie to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſtinctions which were neceſſary to diſcover and make known the Meſſiah, were ſtill found in the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Religion. This is that I am now going to make out.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>One ſee's that even the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman had a diſtinct knowledge of ſome famous places in the Holy Land, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which he gave to his Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that thoſe of her Religion, took a Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> had built an Altar at <hi>Sichem.</hi>

                     <p>One ſee's from the Nineteenth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that Divorces were publickly practiſed amongſt them, as they are to this day.</p>
                     <p>If one makes any Reflexion upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the Sadduces made to our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Woman that ſucceſſively had ſeven Brothers for her Husbands, we ſhall perceive that the deſire of Poſterity being predominant amongſt them, was the cauſe of the continuance of this Cuſtom, which began in the time of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have elſewhere taken notice of the extream carefulneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in preſerving the marks of their Daughters Virginity, which has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly continued down ſince the coming of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel, which informs us that the <hi>Jews</hi> were deprived of the power of the Sword, doth notwithſtanding ſufficiently ſignifie to us, not only the extream horrour which the <hi>Jews</hi> had conceived againſt Adultery; (thus we find Jeſus Chriſt upbraiding the Phariſees, that Adulterers, that is the greateſt of ſinners, entred into the Kingdom of Heaven before them;) but alſo that the Laws againſt Adulterers and Adultereſſes were ſeverely executed.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, one ſee's that by a Judgment of Zeal, as they call it, they brought a Woman to our Saviour which was taken in Adultery, before they went about to ſtone her; for one ought to know that the Law only ſubjected young Women, who
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46528:257"/>were defiled after a Contract, to that ſort of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, becauſe after they were once contracted they were reputed the Wives of thoſe to whom they were betrothed; and ſuch an one was ſhe of whom we read in the Eighth Ch. of S. <hi>John,</hi> and not a perſon actually married, whoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Law, was to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth, That the Law which ſubjected a Virgin to the Will of her Father, and gave him power to make void her Vows at pleaſure, was ſtill in force.</p>
                     <p>I will not mention here what the Ancients tell us of the diſtinction which they ſay was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Virgins and married Women, as well in the Temple, as in their Synagogues; I ſhall only ſay, that this their Tradition is not without ground.</p>
                     <p>It is known that the order eſtabliſhed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for exerciſing the Prieſtly Functions was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved by them: <hi>Zacharias</hi> was of the Courſe of <hi>Abia,</hi> which was the Eighth in order, as is mentioned I <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIV. 11. and he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Incenſe according to the Law, ſet down <hi>Exod.</hi> XXX. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8.</p>

                     <p>I only mention theſe Particulars now, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereafter, that I may avoid tedious Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to enlarge more expreſly, when I ſhall come to ſhew, as to every Article, the exact accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46528:257"/>of the ancient Oracles concerning the Meſſiah, in the perſon of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; together with the uſe of theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which bar any other, except Jeſus Chriſt, from attributing that Title to himſelf, and from abuſing the credulity of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be an eaſie matter for me to make a numerous Liſt of theſe Characters, according to all the different Oracles which God gave to the <hi>Jews</hi> on this ſubject, and to juſtifie the exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of them in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. And indeed it was not without cauſe that God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his People with ſo great a number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies upon this Head, his deſign being thereby to give us ſuch ſolid Grounds for our Faith, by granting to it all theſe ſupports, that nothing might be able to ſhake it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe all of them may be referred to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heads, and that an explication of the chief of them is ſufficient to illuſtrate the reſt, I ſhall ſtop there now.</p>
                     <p>I begin therefore with the Character of the time in which the Meſſiah was to appear, and in which Jeſus Chriſt did actually come into the World. And it being utterly impoſſible for any man to chooſe the time of his Birth, any more than to chooſe an illuſtrious Fore-runner, or a certain place where, or a certain Family of which he is to be born, and much leſs of a Virgin for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; theſe Characters may ſatisfie us, That all thoſe that ever pretended to the Title of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, could not reaſonably do it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the time pointed out by the Prophets for the coming of the Meſſiah, is the very time in which Jeſus Chriſt appeared to the World.</head>
                     <p>I Have made it appear in the Third Part of theſe Reflexions, That the Oracle of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. XLIX. 10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come;</hi> contains a formal Character of the time in which our Saviour was to appear. I am therefore at preſent to ſhew that the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time had wholly loſt the Authority of which they had been poſſeſſed for ſo many Ages, which will moſt evidently appear from theſe four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on the Hiſtory of the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is on the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt, which happened preciſely at the time when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had ordered that all the Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſhould be enrolled; when we find that <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the Bleſſed Virgin went to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> their own City, to liſt their Names in the Regiſter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, which is an authentick proof of the Servitude of that People to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs here to take notice, Firſt, Of <hi>Moſes</hi> his numbring the People by Divine Authority: Secondly, Of the numbring which <hi>David</hi> undertook, and for which he was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46528:258"/>puniſhed by God. Now as God cauſed the People to be numbred, to ſhew that they were all his Subjects, and as <hi>David</hi> numbred them with the ſame reſpect, ſo we muſt conſider this action of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> was a publick Teſtimony of his Soveraignty over the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pompey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Tertullian</hi> appealed to the Publick Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in his Apologetick addreſſed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, who reſided at <hi>Carthage,</hi> he gave a ſufficient evidence that we have no reaſon to ſuſpect the relation of the Evangeliſts. One may joyn to this the manner of the Relation of theſe Facts which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts give us; as for inſtance in the Baptiſm of our Lord, they determine the years in which they were done, not only by the year of the High Prieſt, but alſo by thoſe of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reflexion may be made upon the Character of one of the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Levi</hi> or <hi>Matthew;</hi> who before our Saviour made choice of him was a Publican, and it ſeems as if our Saviour had on purpoſe taken him from that Employ, to be one of his Diſciples, to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inſtance, and ſuch a one as went every where along with him, that the <hi>Jews</hi> by paying Tribute to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had wholly loſt their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Authority, which was to continue till the coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo may be made a third Reflexion, which is very natural, upon a paſſage related by the Evangeliſts. They come and ask our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Whether it were lawful to yield Obedience
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46528:259"/>to the <hi>Romans?</hi> For ſince God had choſen this People, and had given them Judges and Princes of his own chooſing, they had always an extream averſion for any Foreign Domination: Of this we have an illuſtrious Example at the time of the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when notwithſtanding the Remonſtrances by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> yet they could not conſent to ſubmit. This is that with which they are upbraided, <hi>Ezra</hi> IV. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. neither were they more content with this their ſtate of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, at the time of our Saviour; and ſome of their Zealots took this occaſion to tempt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that they might make him odious, which ſide ſoever he ſhould take. Their queſtion is, <hi>Whether it be lawful to pay Tribute to</hi> Ceſar; to which he anſwers with a Divine Wiſdom; <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things which are</hi> Ceſars, <hi>and unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> which words being joyned with the Money that he made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, which was ſtampt with the Emperours I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, do evidently ſhew that the <hi>Romans</hi> were Soveraign Lords in <hi>Judea:</hi> It is known that the coyning of Money is the undoubted Mark of the Soveraignty of that Prince who makes it paſs for Current.</p>
                     <p>But if we muſt give ſome further light to the foregoing Reflexions, we need only obſerve the manner of our Saviour's ſuffering, as it is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to us.

                           <hi>Sanhedr.</hi> fol. 24.2.</note> The <hi>Jews</hi> do agree, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Jeruſalem Talmud,</hi> that Criminal Judgment was taken away from them Forty years before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the Goſpel ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſame thing; the <hi>Jews</hi> did not put Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to death, but they carried him to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:46528:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>and demanded that he might be crucified. When <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King;</hi> they anſwer, <hi>We have no other King but</hi> Ceſar, which Confeſſion was the Confeſſion of the whole Jewiſh Nation, who were aſſembled at the Feaſt of Paſſover. In ſhort, One ſees that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate paſt Sentence upon him. He was ſcourged before they led him to be crucified, which was a puniſhment amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> His Body is not taken from the Croſs, but by permiſſion from <hi>Pilate;</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers are thoſe Dogs, that is, prophane Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens who encloſed him, and tormented him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Deſcription which <hi>David</hi> has made, <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have here but one Anſwer to make, which God's former dealing with that People ſeems ſomewhat to countenance; which is, That as their Seventy years Captivity under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire did not hinder the differring of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that Prophecy of the <hi>Scepters not departing from</hi> Judah, for ſome Centuries after the ſaid Captivity; ſo neither is it neceſſary to ſuppoſe that the Meſſiah was to ſucceed immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ending of the Kingdom of the <hi>Maccabee</hi>'s, and upon the loſs of their Liberty under <hi>Pompey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is a very great difference: For firſt, during the Babyloniſh Captivity, God ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt them ſome form of Government, the great Lords of the Country being chiefly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captives, whilſt the pooreſt and moſt miſerable were left behind.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Captivity laſted only 70 years, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, The firſt Captivity did not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh thoſe neceſſary Marks whereby the lawful Lords of <hi>Judea</hi> might be diſtinguiſhed: thoſe that were of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> as well as thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribes, were very well known, tho' they were not in poſſeſſion of the Kingdom; whereas now every thing is confounded amongſt them; and if one looks into Chriſtian Records, he may find that many of the Kindred of Jeſus Chriſt were put to death, becauſe they could pretend to the Throne of <hi>Judea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, during the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they had Prophets amongſt them who expreſly foretold the end of it, whereas nothing of that kind has yet been ſeen ſince the laſt deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſince which time no Prophet has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared amongſt them, that advantage being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Chriſtians, ſome of which, who next ſucceeded our Saviour, did foretel the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Events that were to follow to the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>But if any one ſhould be ſo nice as to call in queſtion the Reaſons of the difference here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; at leaſt the <hi>Jews</hi> will find nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning the Weeks at the end of which the Meſſiah was to appear, and afterwards to be out off. In ſhort, if it be true that Jeſus Chriſt was born under the Empire of <hi>Augustus,</hi> it is no leſs certain that he entred upon his Miniſtry in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and was crucified the Nineteenth year of his Reign, that is in the midſt of the Four hundred eighty ſeventh year from the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Artaxernes,</hi> that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                     <head type="sub">That Jeſus Chriſt had preciſely ſuch a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner as the Prophets had deſcribed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Meſſiah.</head>
                     <p>ONE will eaſily judge that it was agreeable to the greatneſs of the Meſſiah, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſtate wherein he was to appear to the World, that he ſhould have a Forerunner. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſing himſelf in his manner, the year of the World 3292, almoſt 700 years before the Birth of our Saviour. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> had expreſly foretold the ſame in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, about 420 years before his Appearance. If this be once granted, it is eaſie to conceive that the Son of a Prieſt, living without any worldly ſpendour, and dying a violent death, tho' very glorious for him, was a proper Forerunner to that Jeſus, who himſelf was to be Crucified.</p>
                     <p>Our buſineſs therefore is to enquire whether the Characters which the Prophets give to the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, do agree with <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> in whom the Chriſtians maintain that this Prophecy of <hi>Malachy</hi> was fulfilled. This may be eaſily made out.</p>

                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:46528:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>at a time when his Parents could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves any ſuch thing: The Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> who had declared to <hi>Daniel</hi> the coming of the Meſſiah, by pointing out to him the number of Weeks, was the Meſſenger of the Conception of this Forerunner of the Meſſiah. Several things paſſed at his Birth, and at the time when they gave him his Name, which were very ſtrange, and which could not but be generally known, as well becauſe of the Accident which happened to <hi>Zacharias</hi> in the Temple, as of his quality, being a Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The extraordinary Life which S. <hi>John</hi> led, being a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> ought to be carefully conſidered. He liv'd in a ſolitary place, as the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> did before him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His preaching alſo had the Character of that ancient Prophet, being Thundring as his was; he neither ſpared great men, nor thoſe who had the reputation of the greateſt ſanctity, as the Phariſees particularly, whoſe Pride and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie he touched to the quick.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He ſet forth the coming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah as at the door; <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is at hand;</hi> alluding to the Seventh of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Kingdom of the Meſſiah is repreſented as a Kingdom which was to come down from Heaven, whereas the former Empires had their riſe from the Earth.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, nothing could be more illuſtrious than the Miniſtry of this great Man.</p>
                     <p>He Baptized publickly for the ſpace of one year, ſuch as came to him, ſolemnly engaging them to Repentance, in hopes of the ſuddain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46528:262"/>pearance of the Meſſiah. This Ceremony, which was an imitation of their cuſtom of initiating Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes in the Jewiſh Religion, was plainly an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to eſtabliſh a new Religion, or at leaſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe Corruptions which time had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Jewiſh Religion.</p>
                     <p>In a word, we find him ſo generally followed, that the great Councel of the <hi>Jews</hi> thought fit to ſend Deputies to him, to know whether he were not the Meſſiah they expected: This great Man was ſo far from abuſing the great Credit he had gain'd, that he ſolemnly proteſted, That he was only the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, but was as yet concealed in the midſt of them.</p>
                     <p>His Glory became ſo illuſtrious, that it ſtirr'd up jealouſie in the Mind of <hi>Herod,</hi> who caſt him into Priſon, and at laſt cauſed his Head to be cut off in the Caſtle of <hi>Macherom,</hi> to ſatisfie the lewd <hi>Herodias,</hi> whoſe Marriage, or rather Inceſt, with <hi>Herod</hi> he had reproved.</p>
                     <p>Before S. <hi>John</hi> was beheaded, he ſends his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Jeſus Chriſt, to inform himſelf whether he were the Meſſiah; which our Saviour proves to them by the Miracles which he wrought in their preſence, and by the Teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which S. <hi>John</hi> had before alledged as a proof of his Call.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Facts were ſo illuſtrious, and ſo well known, that S. <hi>John</hi> conſtantly paſſed for a great Prophet amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Phariſees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not daring to queſtion it: He received pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Deputations from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who demanded the Reaſon of his Miniſtry, and he himſelf ſent
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46528:263"/>one to Jeſus Chriſt, that his Diſciples might be acquainted with him, and that they might give him a ſecond publick Teſtimony; and laſt of all he dies a glorious Martyr for his Purity, after he had made a vaſt number of Diſciples, who were ſo well diſperſed in all places, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that ſome of them were found in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who received the Goſpel and the Gifts of the Spirit, in which they had been as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated already by the Baptiſm of S. <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appears afterwards that S. <hi>John</hi> was look'd upon as the Forerunner of the Meſſiah; Jeſus Chriſt ſaith he was the greateſt of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and when <hi>Herod</hi> heard of the Reputation of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſuppoſed that S. <hi>John</hi> was raiſed from the dead.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> not conceiving that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, becauſe they underſtood the Prophecy of <hi>Malachy</hi> literally,
<note place="margin">Mal. IV. 5.</note> which alſo made the LXX add to the Text the word <hi>Thisbite,</hi> in the paſſage of <hi>Malachy;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt declares that it was indeed he of whom <hi>Malachy</hi> had ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> did not do any Miracle; but then he uttered 1. So plain an Oracle concerning the miraculous effuſion of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Diſciples, that we find nothing ſo great or ſo clear in all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophecies; <hi>He that comes after me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He gave a ſecond Oracle, tho' not ſo plain as the former, concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; Whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46528:263"/>purge his floor, and will burn up the Chaff with Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two Oracles contain the end of the old Diſpenſation, and the beginning of the new; the miraculous Gifts of the Spirit were given to facilitate the publiſhing of the Goſpel among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the Temple, happened as well to puniſh the Crime which the <hi>Jews</hi> had committed when they put the Meſſiah to death; as to take away all their pretences of believing that the Meſſiah was not come, who was to appear whilſt that Temple ſtood.</p>
                     <p>But before I conclude this Chapter, I muſt obſerve three or four things, which are very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to confirm the Authority of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which this Forerunner of the Meſſiah hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a Maxim amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Maimonid.</hi> de fundam. legis.</note> That he who is acknowledg'd for a Prophet, may confirm the Authority of another, by atteſting him to be a true Prophet. And this is that which S. <hi>John</hi> did to Chriſt; he was generally accounted a Prophet, and he atteſted that Jeſus Chriſt was ſo. This was that which confounded the Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they demanded of our Saviour by what Authority <hi>John</hi> acted; Jeſus Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their queſtion with another, Whether S. <hi>John</hi> had a call from God?</p>
                     <p>The firſt Obſervation therefore is, That we cannot accuſe him of acting underhand with Jeſus Chriſt, for we do not find any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence kept up between them; one of them was the Son of a Prieſt, the other of a Carpenter's

The Diſciples of the one were very jealous of the Diſciples of the other, and endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire their Maſter with the jealouſie that poſſeſſed themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That the Diſciples of Jeſus are the perſons that wrote the Hiſtory of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> which they do as thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for his Glory and Reputation, tho' at firſt they did not ſtand in the leaſt by him, but rather by that means inflamed. <hi>Herod</hi>'s hatred againſt them, who contributed to the death of S. <hi>John,</hi> as well as of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That when S. <hi>John</hi> was beheaded, who never had any correſpondence with Jeſus Chriſt, it is extravagant to conceive, that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have forged the Teſtimony which they ſay this great man gave to Chriſt, becauſe this would have been to employ the Authority of a Man, who never having wrought any Miracles, and being long ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by the order of <hi>Herod,</hi> ſeem'd to be quite forgotten.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That it is not probable that they could ever entertain a deſign of impoſing on the World in ſuch a matter as this, which related to publick Facts known to all <hi>Judea,</hi> to all the Prieſts, yea to the whole Nation aſſembled at their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Feaſts, to <hi>Herod</hi> the King, and to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>John</hi> themſelves, who would not have been wanting to refute and convince them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary we ſee, that by the diſpoſition
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46528:266"/>which S. <hi>John</hi> had wrought in them, they were eaſily won to the Faith of Chriſt. This is evident from the Example of <hi>Apollos</hi> a Diſciple of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s Diſciples, who became afterwards ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Preacher of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                     <p>One ought to obſerve here a thing, which tho' at firſt ſight ſeems to be of ſmall importance, yet we cannot but think that S. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote it without deſign, and that is the Journey of the Bleſſed Virgin to one of the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> after her Conception, to viſit <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Kinſwoman, the Wife of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and the Mother of <hi>John the Baptist;</hi> I ſhall not mention at preſent any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons of this Journey, which may ſeem to be worthy of the Divine Wiſdom, and ſo I ſhall only obſerve at preſent, that this viſit was made to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in a City of <hi>Judah,</hi> which is a demonſtrative proof that Jeſus Chriſt was of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and conſequently of that of <hi>Judah;</hi> ſo that this is far from being made uſe of as an Objection againſt it, as ſome have done.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that the Prieſts had leave to take a Wife of what Tribe they pleaſed; But who ſee's not at firſt ſight that it was natural for a Prieſt, dwelling in one of the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> to marry in that Tribe amongſt whom he lived; beſides that, the Prieſts had of a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to make Alliances with that Tribe before any other.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing which ought to be joyned to this, is, the manner of <hi>Elizabeths</hi> expreſſing her ſelf to the Bleſſed Virgin, conſidering her as bearing the Meſſiah in her Womb; and upon this account ſhe called her <hi>the Mother of my Lord,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to <hi>Pſalm</hi> CX.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That the Bleſſed Virgin in her Song, where ſhe ſpeaks of her ſelf as the Perſon in whom the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46528:267"/>
                        <hi>Luke</hi> I. <hi>verſ.</hi> 54, 55. which Promiſe concerned the Meſſiah; ſhe ſets forth her ſelf, as Heireſs to the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and choſen before any her Anceſtors, notwithſtanding all their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>He hath put down,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>the Mighty from their Seats, and hath exalted them of low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prieſt, who was well acquainted with the Bleſſed Virgin, at whoſe Houſe ſhe had been during the firſt three Months of her being with Child, and who could not be ignorant of her lineage, alwayes owned her to be of the Family of <hi>David.</hi> It is evident that he look'd upon the Bleſſed Virgin as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Meſſiah, as well as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife. He ſeems to have conſidered the Infant that was to be born of her, as the Redeemer promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Bleſſed Virgin as the Heireſs of <hi>David;</hi> and therefore ſaith, <hi>That God had raiſed up an Horn of Salvation for us in the Houſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant David:</hi> There can be nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing than this Obſervation; for firſt, <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was a Prieſt, that is, one of thoſe to whom the care of the Genealogies of the <hi>Jews</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. 2. He appears to have been very well verſed in the Prophecies which fixed the Meſſiah to the Family of <hi>David.</hi> 3. He conſider'd his Son as the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Oracle of <hi>Malachy</hi> ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in that Son, whom God had ſo miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed upon him. 4. He needed only have examined the Agreements of her Marriage, and he would then certainly know whether the Bleſſed Virgin was not of another Tribe; which would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46528:268"/>have cured him of any poſſible illuſion.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, S. <hi>Luke</hi> obſerves very exactly, that this Journey of the Virgin to her Kinſwoman, and all the Circumſtances which prove the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin to have been of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> were things well known throughout all the Hill-Country of <hi>Judea,</hi> that it might not be pretended that this important Fact was any ways ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, this Genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt is carried up to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> and it is viſible that this was a thing exactly known, eſpecially ſince Jeſus Chriſt always paſſed for the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> blind men themſelves calling him ſo.</p>
                     <p>A third thing to be conſidered is, the Bleſſed Virgins going to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to be there enrolled, according to the Decree of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar.</hi> There had been ſeveral numbrings of the people; the firſt was at the appointment of God himſelf; the ſecond was by an order from <hi>David;</hi> and in both an exact diſtinction was made between the Tribes themſelves, and the Families of each Tribe: And one ſee's that the ſame was obſerved in this laſt Regiſter which was made by <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Decree in the 4000 year of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> went up to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which was the Seat of <hi>David</hi>'s Family: nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears here of deſign or affectation; they made no ſtay at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the occaſion that brought them thither, was abſolutely ſtrange and unlook'd for; and yet it was certainly an accompliſhment of that Prophecy of <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> V. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>But thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Remark upon the Decree of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46528:268"/>great moment, becauſe thereby the Virgins being of the Family of <hi>David</hi> appears to be the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Truth in the World, as having been own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt by the whole Family of <hi>Judah</hi> for three Months. Secondly, By the Genealogy which ſubſiſted entire, as the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> themſelves grant in the Treatiſe <hi>de Sponſal. Chap.</hi> IV. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. where they teſtifie that the Genealogy of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was without difficulty. 3. By the publick teſtimony of all their Kindred, who met in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Remark is, That when <hi>Herod</hi> knew of the Birth of the Meſſiah at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where by the confeſſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> he was to be born, he would have envolved Jeſus Chriſt in the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre which ſwept away the innocent Children, if the ſame Providence which brought him to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> to demonſtrate that he was of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> had not withdrawn him from thence to preſerve him from that Tyrant, who was afraid of being caſt from his Throne by one of <hi>David</hi>'s Heirs.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is, That Jeſus Chriſt did not only often allude to the place of his Birth, in calling himſelf <hi>the Bread come down from Heaven,</hi> the word <hi>Bethlehem</hi> ſignifying the Houſe of Bread; but he conſtantly own'd himſelf for the Son of <hi>David.</hi> Upon this it is that he grounds the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which he makes to the <hi>Jews; How is it that</hi> David <hi>calls the Meſſiah his Lord?</hi> And indeed this Fact was ſo conſtantly owned by all, that even perſons who were poſſeſſed with Devils, did not diſpute it, as may be ſeen in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:46528:269"/>
                     <p>The ſixth is, That tho' two of the Evangeliſts ſet down the Genealogy of our Saviour with ſome difference, yet the <hi>Jews</hi> never took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thence to queſtion Jeſus Chriſt's deſcent from <hi>David;</hi> his Apoſtles always building on that Foundation; which may be ſeen as a thing taken for granted in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> II. and in the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where we find our Saviour always ſtiled <hi>the Son of</hi> David according to the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>To theſe already mentioned we may add the three following Obſervations; the firſt is, That if the Genealogy of our Saviour had not been diſtinctly known, the Apoſtles would never have troubled themſelves to have ſet it down; much leſs would they have plac'd it in the front of their Books, as knowing that the beginnings of Books are always more examined than the ends, and would certainly be ſo by a people who always ſtick very cloſe to their Genealogies. In ſhort, either the Genealogies of the <hi>Jews</hi> were at that time as confuſed as they are at preſent, and ſo they could not have ſerved as Characters to diſcover the Meſſiah by; in which caſe the Apoſtles would have contented themſelves to have hinted, that Jeſus Chriſt always paſt for the Son of <hi>David,</hi> as they have done in ſeveral places of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, without giving us the whole Series of his Pedigree; or elſe they were at that time diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, in which caſe it was the eaſieſt thing in the world to have confuted them.</p>
                     <p>The 2d is, That the differences which are found between the Genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt ſet down by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and that by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> is ſo far from
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46528:269"/>giving us an occaſion to doubt of the Apoſtles faithfulneſs in this matter, that indeed it is a new proof of their exactneſs in a matter of ſo great importance. For it can ſcarcely be imagined but that in ſo long a Series of Ages, there muſt have been ſome of the Anceſtors of our Saviour, in whom that Law took place, which obliged the younger Brother to marry the Widow of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother deceaſed without Iſſue, and ſo to raiſe up Seed to him, which gave occaſion to a Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy not natural, but legal, the Children bearing the name of the deceaſed elder Brother, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing his Eſtate. Now the Evangeliſte have ſet down both theſe Genealogies exactly, which is an invincible Argument of their care and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That it was ſo much the more neceſſary to make this remark in the Genealogy of the Meſſiah, becauſe as we have obſerved elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it was with relation of the deſire of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Birth to the Meſſiah, or of having Children which might live under his Empire, that God at firſt permitted this kind of Inceſt, with the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a deceaſed Brother, which otherwiſe was ſo ſeverely prohibited by the Law.</p>
                     <p>As to the low Eſtate to which the Family of <hi>David</hi> was then reduced, it is viſible that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> reigned with great glory, but <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> ſucceeding them, Ten Tribes fell from him to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in the Year of the World 3029. and the Poſterity of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was afterwards dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who carried <hi>Zedechiah</hi> the King into Captivity in the Year 3416.</p>
                     <p>After their return from Captivity, they were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46528:270"/>entirely thruſt from the Throne: the Prieſts at firſt governing that Nation; the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who were of the Family of <hi>Levi,</hi> reigning in <hi>Judea,</hi> from the return of the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> until <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> who was made Maſter of <hi>Judea</hi> by the favour of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Family of <hi>David</hi> was at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their ancient Seat, and was now ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where Providence ſeems to have removed them from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to take away that object of <hi>Herod</hi>'s jealouſie, which would have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, as we ſee it did when the Wiſe men acquainted him with the Birth of Jeſus, which obliged him to make a diligent enquiry after the place where the Meſſiah was to be born, that Meſſiah whom he conceived to be a Prince, who would rob him of the Soveraignty to which he was raiſed.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, the Bleſſed Virgin was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to a Carpenter. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> tells us that Jeſus Chriſt made Ploughs. See what the Heirs of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were reduced to.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When ſhe came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhe lodged in an Inn, her Kindred being not in a condition to afford her better Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>It appears that the Divine Providence was very careful in executing this Deſign. There were ſome Decays of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> which the Bleſſed Virgin expreſſes in her Song. She was deſcended from the younger Brothers of depoſed Princes, and reduced to private ſtate, ſhe ſpeaks of nothing but of lowneſs and meanneſs, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46528:270"/>in a way of Humility, but to demonſtrate the fulfilling of the Prophecy concerning the Throne of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that this might appear more evidently, and confirm'd by the Law, as it was her Duty to preſent her Son in the Temple, after the Seventh day, with an Offering; ſo ſhe does not offer what is preſcribed to the Rich and Wealthy, but an Offering which is appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in the Law to poor people, as appears <hi>Lev.</hi> XII.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's by the Marriage Feaſt at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> that the Kindred of Jeſus Chriſt were not very Rich, their wanting of Wine on ſuch an Occaſion, was no great Mark of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's alſo, That Jeſus Chriſt frequently repreſents himſelf, as not having where to reſt his Head: On the Croſs he recommends his Mother to one of his Diſciples, and was himſelf maintained by thoſe who followed him.</p>

                     <p>AS this Article is one of the moſt important of our Religion, ſo it is well worth our attentive conſideration. We may take notice here, that according to the Obſervation of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dial. cum Tryph</hi> p. 297. Iſai. 5.</note> that the Fable of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> took its riſe from the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> However, that Prophecy being very expreſs according to the Tranſlation of the LXX. we are to conſider how it was accompliſhed. It will not be enough here to ſay, That ordinarily extream Poverty is a ſufficient bar againſt the ſuſpicion of Adultery; and therefore we deſire the Reader only to call to mind the Obſervations ſet down in the Second Chapter of the ſecond Part of theſe Reflexions on the Books of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Polygamy and Divorces were very frequent in the time of Jeſus Chriſt, as appears from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages of the Goſpel, where God was pleaſed to give us Examples thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God was willing to give us Inſtances of his Severity againſt Adultereſſes, amongſt which thoſe were reckoned who ſuffered themſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed after they were betrothed. We have an Example hereof in the Eighth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel according to S. <hi>John,</hi> which I have illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46528:271"/>in the Fourth Chapter of this Fourth Part.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It appears that the ſame Laws which enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Parents to preſerve the Virginity of their Daughters, did continue, and were ſtill obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as thoſe other Laws which conſtituted the Body of their Religion: When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt upbraids the <hi>Jews</hi> for having changed the true ſenſe of the Law, yet he never reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them upon this account.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Relation ſet down in the Eighth <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> makes it appear that the Waters of Jealouſie ſtill retained their virtue; that which Jeſus Chriſt writ on the Ground being probably nothing elſe but the Curſes which the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the Woman that ſhould violate her Honour.</p>
                     <p>I have made it very evident in the Twentieth Chapter of my Second Part, what was the uſe of thoſe Laws concerning the Marks of Virginity, to prevent any Doubts that might ariſe concerning the ſame: It remains now to conſider the ſeveral paſſages of the Evangeliſts, and to ſee what proofs we can find there to confirm this Point, That <hi>Mary</hi> was indeed a Virgin when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Jeſus Chriſt, and how we may anſwer the Objections which the Enemies of Chriſtianity make againſt this Truth.</p>
                     <p>The Evangeliſts tell us that this remarkable Fact was declared by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who had before foretold to <hi>Daniel</hi> the coming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and ſignified the exact time thereof. The Conception of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by a barren Mother, as well as that of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> had been already declared in the ſame manner; and one
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46528:272"/>Miracle ought to ſerve as a preparation for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a greater.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt ſpeak of the Fact, they ſpeak of it as a thing known through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and which had no Relation to their Maſter. Beſides, we know the Jealouſie that was between the Diſciples of S. <hi>John,</hi> and thoſe of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>But we have a further account beſides of the Meſſage of an Angel to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> after he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his betrothed Wife was with Child; for when he was ready to divorce her, either by expoſing her to the rigour of the Divine Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXII. 23. or elſe by exempting her from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, he is diverted from his intention by this warning from Heaven. In all which we meet with nothing but what is very probable; for <hi>Joſeph</hi> expreſſes his hatred and diſlike, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her to be debauched, and was reſolved not to receive her, but by an Order from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is very remarkable, That we find all things recited in ſuch a manner, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould come to paſs, on ſuppoſition that the Meſſiah was to be born of a Virgin of the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For firſt, We find this event appeared incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the perſon her ſelf, who was deſigned to effect it; becauſe ſhe could not eaſily make the Application at firſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It caus'd exceeding joy to the perſon who ſaw her ſelf choſen by God to fulfil ſo glorious a promiſe, whereby the Family of <hi>David</hi> was to be reſtor'd to its ancient Luſtre. This is evident
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46528:272"/>from the Hymn of the Bleſſed Virgin: which if we compare with the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> we ſhall ſee that that Family ſtill retained all the Piety of their Anceſtors, with all thoſe ſigns of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment which an event of ſuch a nature did juſtly require.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It appears that <hi>Joſeph</hi> acquieſced in this Truth, he who otherwiſe did not ſeem very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, till he was inſtructed from Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a matter ſo rare and difficult to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He retires for ſome time into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and affords <hi>Mary</hi> and her Son all the ſervice they could reaſonably expect from him.</p>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Jerome</hi> alledges three Reaſons why it was needful for the Bleſſed Virgin to be betrothed to <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Original of the Bleſſed Virgin might be proved by the Pedigree of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to whom ſhe was related.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhe might not be ſtoned as an Adultereſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in her Flight into <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhe might have the comfort of a Guardian rather than of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any thing be oppoſed to the belief of theſe matters, but ſome very weak Conjectures: The firſt is, That her being contracted doth ſomething obſcure the diſtinct Notion of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and ſecondly, That the Bleſſed Virgin did always paſs for the Wife of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtyle of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Relation which the Evangeliſts give of this matter, was not known till long after the death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:46528:273"/>
                     <p>But it is an eaſie matter to ſatisfie the mind of any reaſonable Reader in this thing. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Bleſſed Virgin ſhould be betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſecure her Life, which would have been in danger, if ſhe had been delivered whilſt ſhe was reputed to be a Virgin; for ſhe would have been accuſed of Whoredom, and conſequently have been put to death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was neceſſary ſhe ſhould be betrothed, and paſs for the lawful Wife of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that her Son might not be baniſh'd from the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a Baſtard in the Rigour of the Law.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Objection, I eaſily grant that the Bleſſed Virgin always paſs'd for the Wife of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> ſhe her ſelf ſaith, <hi>I and thy Father ſought thee.</hi> But withal, at that very time Jeſus Chriſt unvailed that Myſtery in the Preſence of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> maintaining that he was the Son of God, in whoſe Houſe he was at that time; it was at a ſolemn Feaſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> where the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was aſſembled, and in the midſt of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of their Doctors, that he declared the Temple to be the Houſe of his Father, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conſtantly called it.</p>
                     <p>We find him at another time declaring the ſame in the preſence of his Family at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John II. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</hi> ſaith he to the Bleſſed Virgin; to put her in mind of ſome paſſages which could not but preſerve in her a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular reſpect for him.</p>
                     <p>He gives yet a further degree of light into this matter, when, his Mother ſeeking to come at
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46528:273"/>him, he ſaith, <hi>Who is my Mother, and who are my Brethren,</hi> that is, Kinſmen. 'Tis probable that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was dead, before our Saviour entred upon his Miniſtry; however his making no mention of his reputed Father, ſhews how careful he was to avoid any thing that might obſcure his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Birth.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, it is very conſiderable, that this paſſage being not the only Character which was to diſtinguiſh the Meſſiah from all others, but was to be confirmed by the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, by his Reſurrection, and thoſe other proofs of his Divine Nature, it was at firſt not much inſiſted on, becauſe there was a neceſſity that it ſhould continue vailed for ſome time, upon the account of the frequent Apparitions of Angels, and of God himſelf in a Human form, that ſo the truth of his Humanity ſhould be eſtabliſhed by his Life and Death, before the publication of his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conception.</p>
                     <p>For it is certain that the Apoſtles preached up this Truth, and that the Evangeliſts had put it in writing before the deſtruction of the Jewiſh Common-wealth; and yet we do not find that it was ever conteſted. The Evangeliſts deſcribe the Methods which the <hi>Jews</hi> took to make the Reſurrection of Chriſt to be doubted of, and to ſlight his Miracles; and do we think they would not as well have given us the Objections of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt a thing, of which till then never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtance had been known in the World?</p>
                     <p>I know very well that ſome of the Ancients have told us that the <hi>Jews</hi> were offended, that the Bleſſed Virgin, after ſhe was delivered of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46528:274"/>our Saviour, ſhould ſeat her ſelf in the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Virgins, and that becauſe <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Prieſt maintained her in ſo doing, he was thereupon kill'd by them between the Temple and the Altar, with which our Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids the <hi>Jews.</hi> I know alſo that they affirm that ſhe was forced to confirm the truth of her Virginity, by ſubmitting her ſelf to a ſearch of Matrons: yet I cannot believe that ſhe ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent any ſuch Examination, of which the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Evangeliſts, and S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, fully convinces me, and therefore am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think that no ſuch Objection was ever made againſt her.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is well worth our noting, 1. That the Bleſſed Virgin had <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prieſt as an Examiner and Witneſs of her behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from the beginning, at whoſe houſe ſhe abode during the firſt months of her being with Child, and who publickly divulged the miraculous Birth of his own Son, and his leaping in his Mother's Womb at the Salutation of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Bleſſed Virgin lived many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Paſſion of our Saviour, that ſhe might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo and anſwer any Accuſations of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ſhe alſo had for Witneſſes of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which attended her Conception, all the Diſciples of S. <hi>John,</hi> as well as thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, tho' the Diſciples of S. <hi>John</hi> did not agree with the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That what ſhe declared of her ſelf, was not a Fact which had no traces whereby it might
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46528:274"/>be examined in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Jews</hi> had thirty years to examin the ſeveral particulars which had relation to the Meſſiah, and the miraculous manner of his Birth, at the time when ſhe publiſhed this particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of her life.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That we cannot call in queſtion the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Bleſſed Virgin in the account which ſhe gives us of what concern'd her ſelf, of which no witneſs could be produced, foraſmuch as the accompliſhment of that part of her Prophecy, That <hi>all Nations ſhould call her bleſsed,</hi> clearly ſhews that ſhe had received the Spirit of Prophecy; no more than we can ſuſpect any Forgeries in the Relations of other Prophets, tho' we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſtimony concerning them, but that of the Prophets themſelves.</p>

                     <p>I Have clearly ſhewn that Jeſus Chriſt was born of the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> by <hi>Seth,</hi> by <hi>Noah,</hi> by <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> as it was foretold of the Meſſiah by the moſt ancient Oracles, the encreaſe of which I have already taken notice of in my third part.</p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:46528:275"/>
                     <p>I have afterwards ſhewed, That Jeſus Chriſt was born of a Virgin,
<note place="margin">Gen. III. 15 Iſai. VII. 14.</note> whereby thoſe Oracles, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe thy head,</hi> and <hi>a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son,</hi> ſeem'd to be clearly accompliſhed. Let us now ſee, according to thoſe Oracles, what kind of Perſon the Meſſiah was to be, from his Birth to his Death, according to thoſe Idea's which the Prophets have given us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly tells us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was to reſemble him; <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet like unto me:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. XVIII. 15.</note> which place, as I have obſerved before, has been ſo conſtantly applyed to the Meſſiah, that it appears that not only <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> when he ſent his Diſciples to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Philip</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael,</hi> and the Diſciples when they were asked by our Saviour who he was, but alſo the <hi>Samaritan</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtood it ſo without the leaſt heſitation, and ſaid, that when the Meſſiah ſhould come, he would tell them all things.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, one ſee's an exact proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moſes</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt. Not only becauſe our Saviour was ſaved in his Infancy from the hand of <hi>Herod,</hi> and from a River of Blood, like another <hi>Moſes,</hi> or becauſe <hi>Egypt</hi> ſerv'd for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had hid himſelf in <hi>Arabia:</hi> or becauſe he was rejected by his Brethren, thoſe of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who would have thrown him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from a Rock, becauſe he declared himſelf to be the promiſed Deliverer and Meſſiah, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf the words of <hi>Iſaiah, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhall I now take notice of his being deſpiſed and diſown'd by his Brethren, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46528:275"/>a <hi>Galilean,</hi> whereas indeed he was of <hi>Judea;</hi> For indeed the Meſſiah was to be treated as a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> that is, a contemptible perſon, and a Man of no conſideration; for we may find that becauſe our Saviour was brought up at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> tho' he was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> he was therefore look'd upon as a perſon incapable of any thing that was great;
<note place="margin">John I. 46</note> 
                        <hi>Can any good thing come out of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth? ſaid <hi>Nathanael</hi> to <hi>Philip;</hi> and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees to the Officers whom they had ſent to take Jeſus, <hi>Search and look, for out of</hi> Galilee <hi>ariſeth no Prophet,</hi> much leſs the great Prophet, the Meſſiah, who by way of Eminence is ſo called. 'Tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account that he was called a <hi>Galilean,</hi> not only by the Heathens, but by his own Diſciples too; For the word <hi>Galilean</hi> ſeems to have been a name for one of an impure Extraction, becauſe many of other Nations dwelt among the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Galilee.</hi> But I ſhall take notice of ſeveral other more important Reſemblances between them, and ſuch as have Relation to the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> rather than his Perſon, by referring all to his Preaching, his Miracles, his Predictions, and ſome other Heads of that Nature.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, Jeſus Chriſt that he might at firſt maintain the Character of the Meſſiah, appears in the Temple. <hi>John the Baptist</hi> had heard him called the Son of God, by a very peculiar wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Voice from Heaven. Wherefore we ſee that at his firſt Entry upon his Miniſtry, he drives out thoſe that prophaned the Houſe of God, whom he called his Father, with a Scourge;
<note place="margin">John II. 13, 14, 15, &amp;c.</note> and this he did at the Feaſt of the Paſſover, before the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:46528:276"/>
                     <p>Here is another Character of the Meſſiah; He was to begin the Exerciſe of his Miniſterial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in the Tribes of <hi>Naphthali</hi> and <hi>Zebulon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſai. IX. 1.</note> and this our Saviour exactly accompliſhed by his beginning to preach at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which was in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and he converſed much at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which was in the Tribe of <hi>Naphthali,</hi> according to the obſervation of the Evangeliſts.</p>
                     <p>But I proceed to conſider ſome Circumſtances of his Miniſtry. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had foretold, that the Meſſiah was to preach the Goſpel to the poor; which Jeſus applies to himſelf in the Synagogue at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> declaring that in his perſon that Prophecy was fulfilled;
<note place="margin">Iſai. LXI. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, wherefore the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The choice which he made of his Diſciples from among the meaneſt of the people, and the baſeſt of the crowd which follow'd him wherever he went, ought to paſs for a ſufficient accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>The Meſſiah, according to the repreſentation which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives us of him, was to publiſh the Tidings of the Remiſſion of Sins; and was not this that which Jeſus Chriſt did during the courſe of his Miniſtry?</p>
                     <p>The Meſſiah was to preach the Remiſſion of Sin, in ſuch a manner, as that he might dry up the Fountain of it, at the ſame time, in calling men to the ſtudy of Sanctification; this was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably performed by Jeſus Chriſt, 1. In corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe Abuſes which the Jewiſh Doctors had introduced into the Law. Secondly, In decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46528:276"/>that the Effect of Sanctification was to be look'd for in the heart, rather than in the eyes or hands.</p>
                     <p>One may ſee afterwards, 1. That he knew the heart of man; which proved that he made it. This he teſtifies upon ſeveral occaſions, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers which he made to thoſe that ſpoke to him, and indeed in all his Diſcourſes which were ſuited to the diſpoſitions of the heart of thoſe to whom he addreſt them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he made uſe of Parables, which are Moral Leſſons very eaſie indeed, but withal fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the ſubject than Fables, and more worthy of God: Parables alſo, which were ſo ordinary and familiar amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that we find moſt of them at this day in the Writings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' they apply them to another uſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he deſcended to Particulars, without uſing any thing mean, which men are apt to do when they divide things minutely.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That he forgot no one Precept of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That he examined all the Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made them infinitely recommendable by ſuggeſting ſuch excellent Motives.</p>
                     <p>After all, we are to conſider four things in the preaching of our Saviour, which will fully prove that he was the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That his Doctrine appeared to be wholly Divine; he had never been brought up at the feet of any Doctor; but had his breeding in a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Shop.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That no Crime was ever objected to him, notwithſtanding that he upbraided the Phariſees
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46528:277"/>with theirs; but he ſupported his Doctrine by the Holineſs of his Converſation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he inſenſibly diſpoſed the People to receive him as the Meſſiah, by the Characters which God had given of him in the Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He prepar'd his Diſciples and his Auditors to expect that one day the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould enter into the Church.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Can any thing be ſo ſurprizing, as to ſee a Man who had lived Thirty years as the Son of a Carpenter, to declare himſelf all at once a Doctor, to preach publickly, to cenſure the Doctors of his Nation; to ſpeak of the Law and Prophets with more depth and authority than all that ever went before him. Who can without ſurprize, conceive that a man of the loweſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhould from a Carpenters Shop, come and determine Queſtions about the Law, and tread under his feet the Authority of all the great Rabbins every where, only by an <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſo that none was able to contradict him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when one ſee's our Saviour upon the Mount explaining and defending the Moral part of the Law from the Corruptions into which it was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, he appears not only as great as <hi>Moſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but even as God himſelf, when he publiſhed his Laws to that his ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>Neither ought any one to have leſs admiration for that perfect Innocence which ſhone through the whole courſe of his life: What Crime had they to charge him with when they put him to death, he who accuſed his Enemies of ſo many? <hi>Who of you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>accuſeth me of ſin?</hi> We find
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46528:277"/>him only accuſed of words ill underſtood, which they were reſolved to miſinterpret: His ſaying, <hi>That if they deſtroy'd that Temple, he would rebuild it in three days,</hi> was laid to his Charge as a Crime; And yet theſe words could not have been height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Crimes, if they had been ſpoken in the ſame ſenſe which they put upon them. This was an eſſential Character of the Meſſiah, who was to be the Reſtorer of Holineſs, according to the Idea which the Prophets gave of him.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould take notice afterwards that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his Sermons did by little and little diſpoſe the Minds of his Auditors and Diſciples, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and believe him to be the promiſed Meſſiah. The firſt act of his publick Miniſtry was an effect of his zeal for the Holineſs of a Temple conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to his Father: He drove the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, at the Feaſt of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, which action of his was a ſolemn profeſſion that he was the Son of God. Soon after at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> he applies to himſelf that Prophecy of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> &amp;c. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf yet more diſtinctly in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the ſecond Paſſover which he celebrated during the time of his Miniſtry, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he was the Meſſiah, according to the account which the Evangeliſts give us; and he explains himſelf yet more particularly upon <hi>John the Baptiſts</hi> Meſſage to him. By which means this Truth became already ſo illuſtrious, that the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes would proclaim him King, that is, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own him for the Meſſiah, and obey him as their rightful Soveraign. And laſtly, He explains himſelf in this matter by a Queſtion, When he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46528:278"/>asked his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Matt. XVI.</note> What Cenſures were paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in <hi>Judea,</hi> and what they themſelves thought of him.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, It is certain that Jeſus prepared the Minds of his Diſciples to look for the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which alſo was the Character of the Meſſiah.
<note place="margin">Gen. XLIX. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> had propheſied of old, <hi>To him ſhall the gathering of the People be.</hi> But I ſhall paſs by the Oracles which foretel this matter. What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Hiſtory of the Prodigal, unleſs it be the Calling and the Return of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the eldeſt Son (the <hi>Jew</hi>) being extreamly troubled at it. What means that ſaying of our Saviour, That <hi>he had other Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. or his Prediction, That <hi>many ſhould come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>when the Children of the Kingdom ſhould be cast forth.</hi> I ſhall take notice in another place, of the frequent Repetition of ſuch like Oracles, and their exact accompliſhment. Theſe are ſufficient at preſent to juſtifie the ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this laſt Reflexion, and the truth of this Concluſion at the ſame time, that if one exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Life and Preaching of our Saviour, he may find all thoſe Characters by which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah might be known. Let us now proceed to the Conſideration of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>

                     <p>Neither are theſe that follow any leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; he reſtores ſight to two blind men, he caſts forth a dumb Devil, he aſſwages a Tempeſt by his word, he delivers two poſſeſſed perſons, and permits the Devil to go into the Herd of Swine of the <hi>Gadarenes;</hi> he feeds above Five thouſand perſons with two Loaves and five Fiſhes; he walks upon the Sea, and calmeth a ſecond Tempeſt; he caſts forth a Devil from a Daughter of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a <hi>Canaan,</hi> who was poſſeſſed; he cures one deaf and dumb; he feeds Four thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with ſeven Loaves; he reſtores ſight to a blind man of <hi>Bethſaida;</hi> he caſts out a Devil, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Diſciples had in vain attempted it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores ſight to one born blind; he cured a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman; he cures one of the Dropſie on the Sabbath day; he raiſes <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, after he had been dead four days; he heals ten Lepers afterwards; he reſtores ſight to a blind man at his entring into <hi>Jericho;</hi> and cures the lame and blind in the Temple it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral Characters which aſſure us of the faithfulneſs of the Evangeliſts in theſe their Relations: 1. They wrote theſe things to convert the <hi>Jews</hi> before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. They markt the Circumſtances very exactly, and none could be ignorant of them, ſince they all went thrice a year up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 3. The Facts which they relate were laſting, and ſuch as might be examined. 4. They ſpeak of Facts which they ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt was willing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46528:279"/>ſhould be beyond all conteſt, that they might be the better examined. 5. They ſpeak of thoſe Facts which they maintain to be the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Oracles concerning the Meſſiah whom the <hi>Jews</hi> expected.</p>
                     <p>But there are not fewer Characters of Truth in the Miracles of our Saviour to buoy them up: The firſt is, That moſt of the Diſeaſes, which Jeſus Chriſt cured, are deſcribed as abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable; this Obſervation is of great moment, as well to diſcover to us the infinite power exerted by Jeſus Chriſt, as to make known the extaordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wiſdom of the Apoſtles, who being men without learning, did notwithſtanding ſet down the ſymptomes of the Diſeaſes which their Maſter cured, far beyond what might be expected from their Natural Capacities.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reflexion belongs to the Subjects upon whom theſe Miracles were wrought; for we ſcarce find any of them, except his curing S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Mother in Law, to be wrought upon perſons who had leaſt relation to Jeſus Chriſt: He heals the Servant of the High Prieſt, the Son of the Ruler of a Synagogue, the Son of a <hi>Roman</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, and ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>A third Reflexion may be drawn from the places where they were done, and from the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that were preſent. In ſhort, They were wrought in publick places, in the midſt of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Synagogues; ſome in <hi>Judea,</hi> ſome in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> ſome at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Naim, Sidon,</hi> &amp;c. they were ſubmitted to the examination of the moſt implacable Enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Paleſtina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:46528:280"/>
                     <p>One may add alſo, That theſe Miracles were of very different kinds, wrought in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with very conſiderable Circumſtances, at the moſt ſolemn Feaſts, the <hi>Paſſover</hi> and <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One ought to conſider alſo, That <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was full of thoſe whom our Saviour had cured; and that all the <hi>Jews</hi> who came up three times in a year to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not but take notice of them.</p>
                     <p>One ought afterwards to obſerve, That Jeſus Chriſt communicated to his Diſciples the power of working Miracles in the ſecond year of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, which none elſe had ever done before.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly it muſt be obſerved, That theſe Miracles were laſting; The three dead men, whom our Saviour raiſed to life again, were very young, and who in all probability lived longer than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit old men, were in the ſight of all <hi>Judea;</hi> and other ſick and infirm perſons, that he had healed, enjoyed life and health. 2. In ſhort, the Relation of Chriſt's Miracles which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſent to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſufficiently teſtifies that they were Facts generally known. And 3. That the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of them could ſo little be conteſted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> rather choſe to accuſe him of doing them by ſome Magical ſecret, than to diſpute the truth of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Reflexions ſufficiently confirm the truth of the Evangeliſts relation, and of the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt. To agree to what has been ſaid, we need not refute the folly of thoſe, who have compared the Miracles falſly attributed to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Tyanaeus,</hi> with thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt. One hardly knows at this day whether ever there was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46528:280"/>ſuch a man as <hi>Apollonius;</hi> whereas ever ſince the Apoſtles there have been Chriſtians, who have read the Hiſtory of the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, and who have believed them after a due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Which of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s his Diſciples was ever ſo bold as to ſay to Heathens, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did in the ſecond Century, in his Apologetick, <hi>Bring to us what poſſeſſed perſons you pleaſe, and we will heal them in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we ought alſo to add one thing more, That theſe Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt were exactly ſuch as ought to have been made to prove him to be the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They were exactly ſuch as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning the Meſſiah, <hi>Chap.</hi> XXXV. as may be ſeen by comparing them with the Text.</p>
                     <p>One ought only to obſerve, That this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter is ſo peculiar that it diſtinguiſhes the Meſſiah from all the other Prophets, who went before him; for none of thoſe to whom God had given power to work Miracles, had either given ſight to the blind, or power to the lame to walk.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They perfectly came up to the end of his Miniſtry, as he was the Meſſiah; For it was his deſign to aſſure his Diſciples of the immortality which he promiſed to them; and theſe Cures, and theſe Reſurrections which were wrought only by his word, were ſufficient to convince them, as well of the Soveraign power he had to execute his Promiſes, as of his goodneſs which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to confirm the Faith of his Followers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some of his Miracles were ſuch as evinced his likeneſs to <hi>Moſes;</hi> he changes Water into Wine at <hi>Cana,</hi> he feeds many thouſands in the Deſert,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46528:281"/>he walks on the Water, and makes one of his Diſciples to walk with him; as <hi>Moſes</hi> changed the Waters to Blood, and had cauſed Manna to rain down upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and had opened the Sea for their paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. One ought to obſerve here, That if Jeſus Chriſt's Miracles were not like thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> two only excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> his curſing of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Fig-tree, and the drowning of the Swine; this was to ſhew that he was not come like <hi>Moſes</hi> to execute the Judgments of God, but to exerciſe Acts of Grace and Mercy; thoſe now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being ſufficient to evince it was not for want of power.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman argued very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally when ſhe ſaid concerning Chriſt, <hi>When the Meſſiah ſhall come, will he do greater ſigns than theſe;</hi> we may with more reaſon urge it now, ſince we know not only that Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought ſuch great Miracles, but alſo conferr'd upon his Diſciples a power of doing greater Miracles than himſelf ever did.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That the Predictions of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, clearly prove him to be the Meſſiah.</head>
                     <p>ONe might have obſerv'd, That <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> foretold many things concerning the perſon of our Lord, and the glory of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46528:281"/>that <hi>Simeon</hi> foretold that he was to be <hi>a ſign which ſhould be ſpoken againſt;</hi> and it is known how exactly theſe things were fulfilled. But it will be more for our purpoſe to examine thoſe Propheſies which were pronounced by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I pretend not to repeat them all here, nor to ſhew by how many ways, and upon how many occaſions Jeſus Chriſt did reiterate them: this would take up too much time; I ſhall only ſet down the chief of them, and add ſome few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.</p>
                     <p>When Jeſus Chriſt calls the Fiſhers to follow him, he foretels that he would make them Teachers of the World; <hi>I will make you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Fiſhers of Men.</hi> He promiſes to make them famous by Miracles, and to ſend them the Gifts of his Holy Spirit, which the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had now for above 400 years been deprived of.</p>
                     <p>He promiſed to give them an Authority over the conſciences of men, ſo that what they ſhould forbid us on Earth, ſhould be forbidden in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>He foretels the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>Many,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall come from the East and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Which is the more conſiderable, becauſe he ſeemed himſelf unwilling to ſhew any favour to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom he called <hi>Dogs,</hi> according to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He foretels the Rejection of the <hi>Jews; The Children of the Kingdom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He foretels the Perſecutions which were to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46528:282"/>happen to his Diſciples from the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as from the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours; <hi>They ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the Synagogues, and into Priſons, being brought before Kings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He foretels that notwithſtanding all theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, yet his Church ſhould not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, aſſuring them that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt her;</hi> but alſo ſhould greatly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and encreaſe, according to what <hi>David</hi> had foretold, <hi>Pſalm</hi> CX. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. alluding to the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain fruitfulneſs which is cauſed by Dew.</p>
                     <p>He above thirty times foretels his Suffering and Death.</p>
                     <p>He foretels his Reſurrection the third day.</p>
                     <p>He foretels that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray him, S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> deny him, that his Apoſtles ſhould be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as they ſhould ſee him ſmitten. He foretels the Martyrdom of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which he was to ſuffer for his ſake, and to S. <hi>John,</hi> that he was to ſurvive the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels that after his Aſcenſion to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he ſhould begin the Call of all the Nations of the Earth; <hi>When I ſhall be lifted up from the Earth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall draw all men unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He often foretels the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>your Houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He foretels that many falſe Meſſiah's ſhould come after him, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould receive, tho' they had rejected him as an Impoſtor.</p>
                     <p>Several Reflexions may be made upon theſe Predictions of our Lord. In ſhort, one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at firſt, That there are three ſorts of them in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46528:282"/>the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> ſome of them were fulfilled ſoon after they were pronounced, as thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Aſs which he ſent his Diſciples for, thoſe of his Death and Reſurrection, of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying him, and the flight of his Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Deſign of theſe was to eſtabliſh the belief of thoſe which were further off, which is the Method of God himſelf the Father of our Lord in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>Some of them related to matters which were more remote, as the Wars for inſtance, which Chriſt foretold, the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the diſperſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, There were ſome whoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at a very great diſtance, after many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſome of them reaching to the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's plainly that this mixture of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Predictions, which are of ſo very different ſorts, is of uſe to confirm the belief, and aſcertain the truth of them, the exact fulfilling of the firſt Oracle making way for the belief and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſecond, and ſo on, till all be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p>One may obſerve afterwards, That Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, on whom he (according to his promiſe) after his Aſcenſion, poured forth the Spirit of Prophecy, did ordinarily follow the ſame Notions and Expreſſions which the Prophets of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>Thus we find Jeſus Chriſt makes uſe of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Notions, where he ſpeaks of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> thus we ſee that he imitates the moſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46528:283"/>illuſtrious Actions of the Prophets, and to make his Predictions the more obſerved, in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophecy of <hi>Zachariah</hi> on <hi>Palm-Sunday;</hi> in the midſt of the acclamations of the People he weeps over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if its deſtruction were already come. Thus Jeſus Chriſt ſaith to S. <hi>Peter, When thou ſhalt be old,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. XXI. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not;</hi> thus foretelling his death; Thus he inſtructs him in the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under a repreſentation of all ſorts of Beaſts, commanding him alſo, even as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Animals, <hi>Slay and eat.</hi> All the <hi>Revelations</hi> are full of ſuch Prophetical Idea's taken from the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> from <hi>Geneſis, Iſaiah, Ezechiel, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But here are other Reflexions of as great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the former.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That the greateſt part of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are nothing but a continuance and more diſtinct explication of the Oracles of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> concerning the Sufferings of the Meſſiah, the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the deſtruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and beſides, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the laſt day of the World, which is the end of Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That theſe Predictions had not the leaſt probability upon which they might rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally have been grounded. What likelyhood was there, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be crucified, he who raiſed the dead, who commanded the Sea and Winds, he whom they would have taken by force to make him their King? What likelyhood was there, that the Apoſtles, a company of poor miſerable <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould bring over the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46528:283"/>the Religion of a man who was accurſed by the Synagogue of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and crucified like a Slave by the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate? What probability was there of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> accuſtom'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, made it their buſineſs to avoid all manner of occaſions that might ſtir up the indignation of their Maſters againſt them. <hi>It is expedient,</hi> ſay they, <hi>rather that one man periſh</hi> (meaning Jeſus) <hi>than to hazard the welfare of the whole Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is, That theſe Oracles were written by the Apoſtles, not only amongſt Diſcourſes of another nature, but alſo linked together in ſuch a Chain, that their connexion will not permit us to believe that they were contrived after the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they relate to, were paſt, and alſo that they are conſtantly related by three Evangeliſts, long time before the things came to paſs, S. <hi>John</hi> being the only Witneſs of the Deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That theſe Oracles gave the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as much grounds to expect Calamities and violent Deaths, as to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, ſo that there is no pretence of doubting that they were not faithfully recorded by the Evangeliſts, and that therefore ſeeing the Accompliſhment has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwered to the Oracle, we ought to look upon them as Divine Oracles.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs that theſe Oracles, no more than the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> were ever committed to the publick cuſtody of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as formerly the Oracles of the Prophets of old were, but this cannot really diminiſh their Authority.</p>
                     <p>I will not obſerve at preſent, that becauſe the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46528:284"/>Temple was to be burnt, it was not proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them there; and 'twas for this reaſon God thought fit to cauſe the Oracles of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be tranſlated long before.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet, that it was very proper that theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, as well as the Books of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſhould be put into the hands of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who thence-forward were to be the People of God, and his Temple.</p>
                     <p>But this I obſerve, that nothing can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more ſolemn than theſe Prophecies of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Diſciples, as well as never any thing was more exactly fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> according to the Oracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as no man is Maſter of the place of his Birth, ſo it is plain that here is no room left for impoſture; neither is a man any more the Maſter of his Death; wherefore to give a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Character to his Prophecy, he foretells his dying at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which accordingly was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in all its Circumſtances; can any thing be more exact?</p>
                     <p>But one may ſay, That it was eaſie for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to forge Predictions ſuitable to the Event, in like manner as <hi>Virgil</hi> hath done in the ſixth of his <hi>Aeneids</hi> of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> One may indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive an impoſture which ſhall be poſſible, and which may anſwer to ſome few Oracles; but I ſhall hereafter ſhew the folly of that thought, when I come to prove the faithfulneſs of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts.</p>
                     <p>But can we conceive ſuch a ſuſpicion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the ruin of Paganiſm, the Victory of Chriſtianity after Ten
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46528:284"/>Perſecutions. 'Tis now above 1600 years that the Chriſtian Religion ſubſiſts, whereas, who could have aſſured the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt that their Doctrine would have had ſo much as one or two followers after their Death? The greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, that of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> have been overturned, and none of them ſingly have been of ſo long continuance as the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, which nevertheleſs was attack'd by all that was great and powerful in the World. Who ſee's not that this is the Empire whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks in the ſeventh of his Revelations, <hi>which was never to have end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt foretold, as it is ſet down by his Diſciples, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never built again: who could tell the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, if they had forged this Oracle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the endeavours of <hi>Julian</hi> to confound this Prophecy, when he began to rebuild the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would be in vain, as indeed they proved by an effect of the Divine vengeance againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were engaged in the rebuilding of it,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ammian. Marcellin.</hi> Lib. 23.</note> under the Authority of that Emperour.</p>
                     <p>Indeed if one reflects on the Oracles of Jeſus Chriſt, one ſhall find them a thouſand times more known than thoſe of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. They were writ by ſeveral Authors, who lived in different places.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They were read over the whole Earth every Lord's day, they have been explained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

                     <head type="sub">That Jeſus Christ died preciſely in the ſame manner as it was foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould dye.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſhewed in my third part, that God had given to his Church ſeveral Oracles to explain diſtinctly this great Truth concerning the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He had ſet this up for a Rule by <hi>Moſes, Curſed is he that hangeth on a Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:46528:285"/>
                     <p n="2">2. He had propoſed by <hi>David</hi> the Idea of the Meſſiah, as having his hands and feet pierced; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> uniting themſelves againſt him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He had foretold by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that the Meſſiah was to be accounted a Malefactor, and put to death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He had repeated the ſame Idea's by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> who deſcribes the manner of his being pierced, which has a natural reference to the notion of Crucifixion.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo ſet down the Reaſons for which God ſeparated the ſeveral parts of thoſe Prophetical Deſcriptions of ſo ſurprizing an Event; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty there was on the one hand to make theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's to be received, which ſeem full of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; the Meſſiah having been at firſt ſet forth as the Fountain of Bleſſing: and on the other hand, their ſeeming incompatibility with the Glory which God had promiſed to the Meſſiah, and by him to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And at laſt, I have ſhewed that theſe Oracles do exactly and clearly deſcribe the things which were to happen to the Meſſiah, which was to be ſo, becauſe of the nature of theſe Events, which were ſo ſtrange, and at ſuch a diſtance from the common Idea's which men have for the moſt part of ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>Our buſineſs therefore only is to conſider at preſent, whether indeed Jeſus Chriſt died in the ſame manner as the Prophets had foretold that the Meſſiah ſhould.</p>
                     <p>This Character is a very illuſtrious one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah. For it is well
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46528:286"/>known that a Priſoner is no longer Maſter of the things that happen to him, neither of the kind of his Death, nor of the manner of his Burial.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, nothing can be imagin'd more fooliſh than to ſuppoſe that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould apply to their Maſter, that he might paſs for the Meſſiah, ſuch Oracles as had not uſually been applyed to the Meſſiah by the <hi>Jews,</hi> amongſt whom they lived, and whom they endeavoured to diſpoſe for the receiving of Jeſus Chriſt as the promiſed Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>Now we cannot conceive any thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act than the Agreement which we find between the Prophecies and the Event.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When Jeſus Chriſt by his triumphant entry into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> riding on an Aſs, had put his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in mind of one paſſage in <hi>Zachary,</hi> he obliged them alſo to caſt their eyes upon another, when he foretold his death, and their flight, as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this Oracle,
<note place="margin">Matth. XXVI. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>I will ſmite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and the flock ſhall be ſcattered,</hi> Zach. XIII. 7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He was beſet with a Band of <hi>Roman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Servants of the principal men amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who apprehended him, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Judas;</hi> which exactly anſwers, 1. To the Deſcription which we find <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXII. <hi>Dogs,</hi> that is Heathens, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> treated as ſuch, <hi>and ſtrong Bulls,</hi> that is <hi>Jews,</hi> repreſented by clean Beaſts, <hi>have beſet me round.</hi> And ſecondly, to that other Prophecy, <hi>He that eats bread with me hath lift up his heel against me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He offers himſelf freely to death, according to that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That he <hi>gave his Soul an offering for ſin.</hi> This appears not only by his going into
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46528:286"/>the Garden, where he knew that he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but alſo by his telling the Souldiers that he was the man they looked for; he oppoſed S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s attempts towards his Reſcue, and declares that he did not fly from death, but was willing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the intent of the Prophecies.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is forſaken by his Diſciples, as he himſelf had teſtified of it as foretold by the Prophets, <hi>Zach.</hi> XIII. 7.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He is ſtruck on the face before <hi>Annas,</hi> as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had foretold <hi>Lament.</hi> III. 30. <hi>He giveth his Cheek to him that ſmiteth him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. He appears before <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> ſurrounded by every thing that was great amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether Lawyers or Church-men, according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> II.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He is ſilent before his unjuſt Judges, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to anſwer the Accuſations which the falſe Witneſſes depoſed againſt him, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, As a Sheep before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth,</hi> Iſaiah LIII. 7. and the deſcription which <hi>David</hi> gives of him. <hi>Pſ.</hi> XXXI. and XXXIX.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They opened their mouths againſt him, in accuſing him of Blaſphemy, as <hi>David</hi> had figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively expreſſed it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXII. 13.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They ſpit in his face, they buffetted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed him the whole night, according to that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> XLIX. 6.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw that Jeſus Chriſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Pilate</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who demanded his Crucifixion, he returned the thirty pieces of Silver, wherewith they purchaſed the Potters field, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called the Field of Blood, and ſet apart by
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46528:287"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> for the burial of Strangers, as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Zachariah</hi> XI. 12. and by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> XXXII. 25.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He is accuſed before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and brought before <hi>Herod,</hi> without juſtifying himſelf of the Crimes laid to his charge, as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXXVIII. and XXVII. 12.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> agree in conſpiring the death of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pſalm</hi> II.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Pilate</hi> deſiring to ſave Jeſus, the <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Barabbas</hi> might be releaſed, and Jeſus puniſhed, as <hi>David</hi> had foretold <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. 14.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Jeſus Chriſt was ſcourged by <hi>Pilate</hi>'s order, which was foretold <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXXVIII. and LXIX. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> LIII. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> LXIII.</p>
                     <p n="15">15.

                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. He is afterwards delivered to the Souldiers, who before they crucified him, inſulted over him with a thouſand Indignities, and ſcourged him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, according to the Prophecies ſo often before alledged.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. They Crucifie him with two Robbers, which anſwers to that Prophecy <hi>Iſaiah</hi> LIII. 12. <hi>He was numbred with Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. They give him Gall and Vinegar to drink, as was foretold <hi>Pſalm</hi> LXIX.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. They pierce his hands and feet in nailing

                     <p n="21">21. He ſuffers a thouſand Reproaches upon the Croſs, according to what we find <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> LXIX. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 10.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And in particular the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him in the very words of <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. <hi>verſe</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Jeſus Chriſt cries out, applying to himſelf the beginning of <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXII. <hi>My God! My God! why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> as he had before applied to himſelf the Prophecy concerning the Meſſiah in the third of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. He commends his Soul into the hands of God, in the very words which we read <hi>Pſalm</hi> XVI.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principal Circumſtances of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, which one ſee's to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeable to the Prophecies going before concerning them: let us now conſider thoſe which followed his death, which we ſhall not find to be leſs particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Bones of Jeſus Chriſt were not broken, as thoſe of the two Thieves, which one may ſee foretold <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXXIV. <hi>verſe</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They open'd his ſide with a Spear, according to the Idea of <hi>Zechariah, Chap.</hi> X. <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. His Body is buried by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> in a new Sepulchre, which anſwers to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> LIII.</p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:46528:288"/>
                     <p>Theſe Remarks do, in my judgment, clearly prove, that in the death of Chriſt all the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters by which the Prophets have diſtinguiſhed the death of the Meſſiah, are actually found.</p>
                     <p>But that we may yet be more ſenſible how juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe Oracles are applyed to Jeſus Chriſt; here are ſome Reflexions upon the application which the Apoſtles make of theſe particular Facts which happened to Chriſt, to thoſe Oracles which I have now mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That the relation of theſe Facts is joyned with an account of the weakneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they all fell: They relate their own flight, and forſaking their Maſter, with S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of him, whilſt they ſet down the courage of thoſe women, and that entire love which they ſhewed to the perſon of Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That the account of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of theſe ancient Oracles is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the Accompliſhment of thoſe which were uttered by Jeſus Chriſt, which alone are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make good his claim.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That our Saviour did never on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion more openly ſtand to his pretenſion of being the Meſſiah, than when he applyed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe Oracles which by their publick conſent were referred to the Meſſiah, which the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time more obſtinately conteſted, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That there never was a more exact deſcription of all Circumſtances which might aſſure us of the truth of any Relation, than that which the Evangeliſts have given us of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, in which we find the places,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46528:288"/>the time, the perſons, their diſcourſes, and other things of that nature, ſet down with extream care.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is, That as this Fact, with all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is the moſt exactly deſcribed of any thing that ever was, ſo it was a matter, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which it was ſcarce poſſible to impoſe upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one. All was done in the face of the whole Nation, who were met together at their moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feſtival: All was done in the preſence of the Soveraign Heathen Magiſtrate, of the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of <hi>Herod,</hi> and of thoſe who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſixth is, That we find an account of ſome Miracles interwoven with this Relation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts concerning the death of Chriſt, and thoſe Miracles as publick, and as little ſubject to ſuſpicion, as the death it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, if we take the pains to examine them.</p>
                     <p>They who come to take Jeſus fall down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the ground; Jeſus Chriſt reſtores the ear of the High Prieſt's Servant which was cut off: there was darkneſs over all the Land from Nine a Clock in the Morning till Noon; the vail of the Temple is rent. Theſe are miraculous actions, and ſuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> might eaſily have refuted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they had been propoſed, if the truth of them had not been beyond all queſtion.</p>
                     <p>From all theſe Remarks it evidently follows, That it is impoſſible to diſpute the Application which the Apoſtles make of theſe Oracles which are ſo particular to the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, as the true Meſſiah: We find every part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation exactly anſwering to the Propheſies; how
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46528:289"/>then can any one doubt of their being fulfilled in him? eſpecially ſeeing it is evident by ſo many other proofs that he was indeed the Meſſiah, and that God has been pleaſed ſo many other ways to confirm the ſame truth.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                     <head type="sub">That Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed again the third day according to the Prophets, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſcended into Heaven.</head>
                     <p>HAving ſhewed in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was crucified under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> for maintaining that he was the promiſed Meſſiah, I am now to ſhew, that according to the Prophecies ſet down in my third part, he roſe again the third day, and afterwards aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. As theſe two Facts are the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of all that are contained in the Goſpel, becauſe if they be denied, all the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip given to Jeſus Chriſt, by the Apoſtles, and a great number of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who received him for their Maſter in matters of Religion, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unlawful; ſo we ought ſolidly to prove that they are indiſputably true. Of which we ſhall be fully convinced by making ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Relation which the Evangeliſts give us concerning them, and we ſhall eaſily find therein all the Characters of Truth.</p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:46528:289"/>
                     <p>There is no neceſſity of obſerving, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, is a Fact which can hardly be believed; and that tho the <hi>Jews</hi> did not all of them look upon it as an impoſſible thing, yet there were <hi>Sadduces</hi> amongſt them, whoſe Doctrine was publickly taught. It is certain, that tho the Diſciples had ſeen Jeſus Chriſt, raiſing three perſons from the dead, and amongſt others <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a little before his death, yet we find that they were not thereby more diſpoſed to believe that Chriſt was to riſe from the dead.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, tho the Evangeliſts tells us, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had foretold, that he was to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third day, which was a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, that the Prieſts to elude the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, deſired of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that a Guard might be ſet on Jeſus his Grave, yet they expreſly tell us, that the Diſciples, none excepted, were in ſuch a Conſternation at the death of Jeſus Chriſt, that they had entirely loſt the hopes of ſeeing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that Propheſie. Some pious Women, who had accompanied him to the Croſs, and were deſirous to ſhew ſome Marks of their Veneration after his death; came indeed to his Sepulchre, but with Spices to embalm his dead Body, ſo far were they from expecting to find him riſen from the dead. Tho theſe Holy Women were convinced of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, by the Apparition of an Angel, by the Diſcourſe of our Saviour himſelf, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of his order, that they ſhould go to <hi>Galilee,</hi> where they ſhould ſee him, yet the Relation which they give of theſe things, is accounted fabulous, ſo that two only of all the Apoſtles had the curioſity
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46528:290"/>to go to the Grave and inform themſelves. Here is a great unbelief amongſt the Apoſtles, which was to be cured: This was a condition wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, if we ſuppoſe them Impoſtors, and that they intended to impoſe upon the World.</p>
                     <p>A Second thing we may obſerve is, That as the Incredulity of our Saviour's own Diſciples was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, ſo we cannot imagine any more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means than were employed to overcome this their doubtfulneſs. If one joyns the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Evangeliſts together, one may find ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of evidence, in thoſe proofs which confirm the truth of the Reſurrection of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is the manner of their being informed of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; Angels at firſt declare his Reſurrection to ſome Women; Jeſus Chriſt afterwards appears to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> all alone; afterwards he appears only to two of his Diſciples, then to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> afterwards he appears to ſeven of them at once, then to all his Diſciples except <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſoon after to the eleven, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> being one of them. After all this, he appears to a greater number of his Followers, till at laſt, having been ſeveral times ſeen of them all, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them all aſſembled together, and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into Heaven in their ſight. It is evident, that as they were informed of this truth one after another, ſo they were more obliged to examine the Fact more attentively when Jeſus Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond degree has relation to thoſe Marks and Characters, by which they were aſſured, that it was Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. The Angels repeat to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46528:290"/>the Women the command which Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death had given to his Diſciples to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galilee;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt appearing to <hi>Mary Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> repeats the ſame to her, and gives her a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commiſſion for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to comfort him in his Affliction, for having denied his Maſter. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to his Diſciples as they went to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> he refers them to the Prophecies, which ſpoke of his Death and Reſurrection; and moreover, when he broke Bread with them, they hear the ſame Prayers which he ordinarily uſed at the bleſſing of it. He appears to them the ſame day the fifth time, and ſhews them his feet and his hands; he repeats the Grant of the Authority which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him; he breathes upon them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> a week after he lets <hi>Thomas</hi> touch him; he appears afterward to ſeven of his Apoſtles upon the Lake of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> where he confirms S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his charge, from which his denying of Chriſt might ſeem to have excluded him, after he had wrought a Miracle in the draught of the Fiſhes, which was like ſome Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which he had wrought before his death. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he appears upon the ſame Mountain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> where in all probability he had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured before, and is there ſeen of Five hundred of his Diſciples at once. And laſt of all he appears to them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after their return from <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> and from thence goes with them to <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where after he had told them of the abſolute power which God had given them, he commands them to go and Baptize in his Name, he foretels the Miracles which they ſhould work, and the Gifts which they ſhould receive at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46528:291"/>theſe ſo very different Circumſtances were only deſign'd to aſſure their Eyes, their Hands, their Minds, their Conſciences, that it was the ſame Jeſus whom they had always followed.</p>
                     <p>It is worth our taking notice of the diverſity of theſe Circumſtances for the certainty of this Fact, which abſolutely prevent all pretences of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Jeſus Chriſt appears ten ſeveral times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death; he appears five times on the very day of his Reſurrection; he appears at ſeveral hours, to different perſons, in ſeveral places, but always to perſons to whom he was familiarly known, to thoſe who were not at all credulous; the firſt news they had of his Reſurrection ſeem'd only to raiſe their Scruples, if the teſtimony of their Senſes, which ſaw him and touched him, had not removed all ſuſpicions. Jeſus Chriſt appears to them in places where he had wrought many Miracles, and where he had often before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them.</p>
                     <p>But one may make another more important Reflexion, upon the time and the day wherein our Saviour roſe again. Of the ten ſeveral times in which he appeared to his Diſciples, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five times on the day of his Reſurrection; he appeared to them eight days after, and after that, the eighth day, which he ſignalized by his frequent appearing to his Diſciples, was conſecrated to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the memory of this Event every week: One finds certain tokens hereof in the Writings of the Apoſtles, and it is known that all Chriſtians after them did inviolably obſerve this Law. Now let any one conſider whether it would have been poſſible to introduce this Cuſtom in the time of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46528:291"/>the Apoſtles, if the Reſurrection of Chriſt had not been a Fact confeſſed of all hands. Can any one conceive that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples, who were witneſſes of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and who celebrated the memory thereof by a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could have been ſo ſtupid to eſtabliſh a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom which would put People upon examining the Fact, and have convinced them in a little time, ſince none of thoſe that followed them would have ſubmitted to this practiſe, if they had not been convinced by their Eyes, and their other Senſes, and by a thouſand other proofs of the truth of ſo capital a Fact, which was ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> of which they were obliged to make a ſolemn commemoration two and fifty times every year, as long as they liv'd.</p>
                     <p>Let us add to this Remark, which we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where urged, with reference to the Creation, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reflexion upon a Fact which the Evangeliſts tell us: They tell us that tho' the Reſurrection of Chriſt was accompanied with very peculiar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſufficient to convince both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> of the truth of it, being uſher'd in with an Earthquake, with Apparitions of Angels to the Souldiers that guarded the Sepulchre of Jeſus, and were frighted thereby, yet the Council of the <hi>Jews</hi> contrived, with the Souldiers, a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lye to out-face it, and accordingly the Souldiers coming before <hi>Pilate,</hi> tell him that the Diſciples had ſtoln away the Body of Jeſus whilſt they ſlept, and his Diſciples tell us, that ſince this hath been the common Opinion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not ſo much as take notice here of the palpable falſity of this Depoſition; for if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46528:292"/>were aſleep, how could they depoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fact which was done at that time: If they were not aſleep, why did not they hinder the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from taking the Body of their Maſter away? How could they affirm that Thieves had taken him away, when the Linnen Clothes wherein his Body was ſhrouded, being left in the Grave, and the Napkin that was about his head, being folded up in a place by it ſelf, do abſolutely evince that he was not taken away by perſons that were in fear of a ſurprize? What probability is there, in ſhort, to ſuſpect that his Diſciples, who forſook Jeſus Chriſt whilſt he was yet alive, who fled from him at that time, ſhould undertake ſuch a hazardous Attempt to have his Body only?</p>
                     <p>Neither will I inſiſt upon a Repreſentation of the Apoſtles ſincerity, which made them give us in their Hiſtories a plain account of the report which was ſpread againſt the belief of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus, before ever that the Diſciples had atteſted the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But I obſerve another very particular Character in their Relation, which is, that it was impoſſible for them to eſtabliſh this Fact of the Reſurrection, without accuſing thereby the whole Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the moſt ſhameful and crying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture that ever was; to write a thing of this nature againſt the Heads of that Religion, was to ſacrifice themſelves to the hatred of the Publick, and to expoſe themſelves to inevitable ruin. In ſhort, let us imagine whether after a charge of this nature, it was eaſie for the Apoſtles to publiſh their Books, and preach publickly that Jeſus Chriſt was riſen from the dead? And yet this was what
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46528:292"/>they did with a ſurprizing diligence when they inſerted this terrible Accuſation into their Books and Sermons; which alone is ſufficient to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that they were infinitely convinced of the Reſurrection, and alſo in a condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all Gainſayers, as we ſhall ſhew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>One may add to this proof the Converſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the care which he afterwards took to confirm this truth of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. He was a declared Enemy of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Chriſtian Religion, and yet ſoon after the Death of Chriſt he preaches him up for the Meſſiah: How came this ſuddain change? He aſſerts that he had ſeen in Heaven this Jeſus who was riſen from the dead, and received from him the Apoſtleſhip; accordingly we find him preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by theſe Orders, without any communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had with the firſt Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. He relates theſe matters in a manner ſo little affected to advance his Miniſtry in the minds of the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who preferred S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles before him, that there is no ground left to doubt of them.</p>
                     <p>One ought to make a like Reflexion upon the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion; he was a Proſelyte, that is, a <hi>Gentile</hi> by Birth, but a <hi>Jew</hi> by Profeſſion, and by the Imployment he was in, he had occaſion of being more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the depoſition of the Souldiers, who probably were not unknown to him, for he was in the Garriſon at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which was not far from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet however this <hi>Cornelius,</hi> after he had a viſion which commanded him to ſend to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46528:293"/>
                        <hi>Joppa,</hi> a place made famous, becauſe <hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet ſet Sail from thence, who was a Type of the Meſſiah in his Death and Reſurrection; this <hi>Cornelius,</hi> I ſay, embraced the Chriſtian Religion, becomes the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and dyed a Martyr for the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The great affection which S. <hi>Luke</hi> had for S. <hi>Paul</hi> confirms the ſame truth. S. <hi>Luke</hi> had never ſeen our Saviour, he was born at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where in all probability he exercis'd his Profeſſion of Phyſick, yet he was converted to Chriſtianity, and follow'd S. <hi>Paul</hi> in all places, and writ the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Miracles and Preaching: who doubts but that the reaſon hereof was, becauſe he had ſeen the Dead whom Chriſt had raiſed to life, and had ſeen S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom Jeſus Chriſt had dignified with the Apoſtleſhip, raiſe others alſo from the dead.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that thoſe who were firſt convinced by the Relation of the Apoſtles, muſt needs have had very evident proofs of the truth of it. The <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>Sadducees</hi> amongſt them, who denied the poſſibility of the Reſurrection in general; the Council of the <hi>Jews</hi> eſpecially had made it their buſineſs to decry the Conduct, the Doctrine, and the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, and in particular to make the belief of his Reſurrection ſuſpected; and ſo much the more becauſe Jeſus Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it, and his Apoſtles maintained that it was come to paſs accordingly. If in oppoſition to theſe ſtrong prejudices, there had only been the depoſition of two or three perſons to confirm this Fact, there would have been reaſon to doubt of it; but we find that this thing, which of it
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46528:293"/>ſelf ſeems hard to be believed, and was otherwiſe ſo much conteſted, is, 1. Proved by ten ſeveral Apparitions; 2. It is atteſted by above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Diſciples; 3. It was publickly preached by the Diſciples of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf, and throughout all <hi>Judea,</hi> where it was moſt of all diſputed: 4. It was received by the very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Jeſus Chriſt, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and by thouſands of thoſe, who having demanded his Death, were converted by the preaching of the Apoſtles: 5. It was confirmed by the Martyrdom of the greateſt part of them; and 6. It was not not only authoriz'd by the preſence of the three perſons whom Chriſt had raiſed to life, and who lived one of them at <hi>Bethany,</hi> fifteen furlongs from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where Jeſus aſcended to Heaven; another at <hi>Naim, &amp;c.</hi> But it was further verified by ſeveral Reſurrections wrought by the Apoſtles, to whom Chriſt had vouchſafed that aſtoniſhing power.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo a very conſiderable thing that the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> continued near for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after the time that the Apoſtles under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took openly to preach up the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as the capital Article of their Religion; and yet in all that time it was never oppoſed by any publick Writing either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> If the <hi>Jews</hi> in their unjuſt intrigues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt and his Religion, endeavoured to abuſe the World in this matter, with calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Stories, neither have the Apoſtles been wanting to accuſe the principal Men of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of impoſture, and they have deſpiſed the moſt cruel of their Puniſhments, to maintain the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46528:294"/>of their Charge; and yet none of them would undertake to juſtifie the Calumnies of their Council, tho' they ſaw Chriſtianity ſpreading it ſelf not only over all <hi>Judea,</hi> but in all parts of the World. To ſpeak of it, as it is, this Conduct of theirs was a manifeſt betraying of their Cauſe, or rather an open acknowledgment that what they had publiſhed againſt the innocency of the Diſciples, and the truth of the Reſurrection of Jeſus was without all ground.</p>
                     <p>I foreſee only one probable difficulty which can be oppoſed to the ſolidity of theſe Reflexions. A <hi>Jew</hi> may demand, why Jeſus Chriſt after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection did not converſe as openly amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> as before, that ſo he might have been known by thoſe who had crucified him, which would have put the truth of the Reſurrection out of doubt?</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak truth, this Objection is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for 1. Jeſus Chriſt had threatned the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> they ſhould ſee him no more, and he ought to make good his threatning. 2. Who ſees not that they would have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his appearing amongſt them as a phantaſtick Apparition, after they had ſeen him work ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles, and had attributed them to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. 3. I ſay that ſuch an Apparition was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our Saviour's Doctrine in the Parable of the Rich man;
<note place="margin">Luke XVI. 29, 31.</note> 
                        <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, if they hear not them, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi> 4. Jeſus Chriſt having for the moſt part converſed in <hi>Galilee</hi> at <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> it was to the <hi>Galileans</hi> and his Diſciples that he was chiefly to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46528:294"/>to be acknowledged by them, as being the perſons who were particularly to bear witneſs of this truth. After ſo ſtrong a preſumption as the Governours of that People had of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, founded upon the Earthquake which accompanied it, and upon the Depoſition of the Souldiers to whom the Angels had appeared, had not they all the reaſon in the World to believe the teſtimony of the Apoſtles concerning this truth, which they heard ſeveral times atteſted by them in full Council, and ſaw confirm'd by miraculous Cures which they could not queſtion in the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Is not this Objection the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing in the World? For let us ſuppoſe that theſe Conſiderations are not ſtrong enough to juſtifie our Saviour's conduct when he gave theſe proofs of his Reſurrection, doth it follow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not make choice of means (in order to perſwade the <hi>Jews</hi>) which they preferr'd before others uſed by him, without any ſolid Reaſon, that therefore we muſt reject the depoſition of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witneſſes who unanimouſly atteſt it? Since Jeſus Chriſt had raiſed three perſons to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which then lived in <hi>Judea;</hi> ſince <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had continued fourty years after the death of Chriſt; ſince ſixty ſolemn Feaſts were celebrated in that time, where all the <hi>Jews</hi> had an occaſion to examine the truth of theſe Facts, and the truth or falſity of the Accuſation charged upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that multitudes of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were converted at the preaching of the Apoſtles, who reduced all to this Queſtion of the Fact of the Reſurrection
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46528:295"/>of our Saviour, is not this an invincible proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Accuſations and Suſpicions of the Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as the Witneſſes who maintain the Reſurrection of Chriſt, are the very ſame that atteſt his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and that they aſſert it with the ſame proofs, and the ſame zeal, the Reflexions here ſet down may ſerve for that alſo, and the rather becauſe I am next to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſending of the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which is an undeniable proof, both of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt and his Aſcenſion; and that theſe very Gifts of the Holy Spirit enabled the <hi>Jews</hi> to write, preach, and publiſh throughout all the World the truths of that Chriſtianity which we now profeſs.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That Jeſus Christ ſent to his Apoſtles, and to the Primitive Chriſtians, the miraculous Gifts of his Holy Spirit, as he had promiſed in the Ancient Prophecies.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſhewn that the Prophecies of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> ſpeak very plainly of this ſending of the Spirit, as a Preliminary to the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which was the great deſign of God. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeaks of it as ſuch, and makes this wonder to precede the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46528:295"/>S. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts. Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks very particularly of it as ſuch, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Prophecy, where he ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates that the Spirit of Prophecy ſhould from thence forward ſo reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, that it would not be found any longer among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe City and Temple ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>At preſent my buſineſs is to ſhew that this thing has been exactly fulfilled, according to the deſign which God had laid down in the Prophets. To be convinc'd of this, we need only make ſome? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the Relation which S. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us of it in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He tells us therefore, that fifty days only after the death of Jeſus Chriſt, the Apoſtles having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and being aſſembled there, they received the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, that is, the power of ſpeaking all ſorts of Languages, to make them fit to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, and to explain the moſt ſublime My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Saviour's Religion.</p>
                     <p>Every thing is conſiderable in this Relation of S. <hi>Luke:</hi> 1. That he relates this Fact as happening fifty days only after the Jewiſh Paſſover, when Chriſt was crucified; the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> having been witneſſes of his death. 2. That he relates it as happening in the ſame City where Jeſus Chriſt was condemned, that the ſame Multitude, who after fifty days were again aſſembled there at this Feaſt, might be Witneſſes of this miraculous Event. In ſhort, it plainly appears that this new Law from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> was ſolemnly promulg'd in the preſence of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46528:296"/>from all parts of the World, as the old Law was, when all the People aſſiſted at the foot of Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> 3. That theſe Gifts were granted to all the Diſciples of our Saviour; Gifts, which till that time had been wholly unheard of, and whereof ſome part only had been granted to ſome Prophets, and to ſome Prieſts, and of which none had been made partakers ſince the time of <hi>Malachi;</hi> God having ſo ordered it, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the <hi>Jews</hi> might be the more inflamed for the Meſſiah's coming, as alſo that upon his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming he might the more eaſily be diſcerned. 4. That this was a Fact openly known amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and differently interpreted by them; ſome ſaying, <hi>They they were full of new Wine.</hi> 5. That the Apoſtles aſſerted by the mouth of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that this was an Accompliſhment of the ancient Oracles, as well as of the Promiſes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. 6. That they declared that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and this miraculous Donative, had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joel.</hi> 'Tis certainly therefore very natural to make theſe following Reflexions upon the Relation of ſo conſiderable an Event.</p>
                     <p>The firſt will confirm the truth of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fact, if we conſider that it is abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that S. <hi>Luke,</hi> a wiſe man, ſhould be ſo raſh, as to relate a matter of this nature, if he had not been fully convinc'd of it; and if it had not been an eaſie thing to have convinc'd his Readers thereof alſo; nothing more being required for their conviction, but the preſence of one of thoſe firſt Chriſtians, and to make a trial of this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural vertue beſtowed on them, for which there were frequent occaſions.</p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:46528:296"/>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt obſerve that this Relation of S. <hi>Luke</hi> is as it were the foundation which he lays down, to make his Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> to appear juſt and reaſonable, and to juſtifie the Apoſtles conduct in preaching the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not only contrary to the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who looked upon them as wholly excluded from the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Covenant; but alſo contrary to the ſeeming Maxim of Jeſus Chriſt, who acted only as the Miniſter of Circumciſion; and contrary to the pretenſions of many Chriſtians, who after the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, took it very ill that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had preached to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſuppoſes that this Fact came to paſs in ſuch a manner, that it was followed by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences as illuſtrious as they were incredible. Twelve poor Fiſhermen undertook to go and preach to all the World, that their Maſter, who fifty days before was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the proſecution of the whole Synagogue, and by order of one of the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was not only living, not only aſcended into Heaven, but that he alſo had given them the power of ſpeaking all ſorts of Languages, of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all Diſeaſes, and even of raiſing the Dead.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They go yet further, they boldly maintain that Jeſus Chriſt had given them a priviledge of communicating the ſame power to all thoſe who would believe that he was the promiſed Meſſiah, and this without any other myſtery but the bare laying on of their hands, after they had received them by Baptiſm into the Profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:46528:297"/>
                     <p>Nothing could have been more eaſie than to convince them of the contrary, unleſs they had confirmed the truth of their Aſſertion by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Conſequences of that firſt Miracle. The Fact was publickly acknowledged; <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is convinced thereof, and he who had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo famous by his Sorceries, becomes a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. S. <hi>Luke</hi> in a Hiſtory of the Actions of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, relates the continual Miracles wrought by the Apoſtles, and particularly by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he conſtantly followed.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to me that if one conſiders the Hiſtory it ſelf, and the perſon who made it, that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a true and faithful Relation; however there are other teſtimonies which invincibly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſame Truth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Goſpel was in effect eſtabliſhed in moſt of the Provinces and great Cities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Chriſtians of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, &amp;c.</hi> which is an evident Argument that there were Chriſtians every where, that is, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe twelve Fiſhermen, who underſtood nothing but their native <hi>Syriack</hi> Language; How then were all theſe Nations converted, without ſuppoſing the truth of the Miracle at the <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles ſpeak to them of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts as of a common thing; S. <hi>Paul</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying ſome part of his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> to regulate thoſe diſorders which aroſe in the Church, by reaſon of the abuſe of thoſe Gifts. S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the power that the Prieſts had to cure the ſick; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhes for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46528:297"/>of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> to communicate thoſe Gifts to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They take occaſion to raiſe the Dignity of the Goſpel above that of the Law, in calling it the Miniſtry of the Spirit, in oppoſition to the Letter of the Law, notwithſtanding the Tables of the Law had been given to <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſo very il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious a manner.</p>
                     <p>It is of great moment here to conſider. Three things, which alone are ſufficient to confirm the truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That this Miſſion of the Spirit is alone ſufficient to convince Mankind of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Jeſus Chriſt. God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſpeaking one Language, and afterwards he divided the ſame to make a confuſion amongſt the Builders of <hi>Babel;</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt doth the ſame thing to confirm the Glory and Belief of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. God vouchſafes the power of Miracles to ſome, Jeſus Chriſt communicates it to a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number; Miracles not having been ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, becauſe no People ever had that power in all the foregoing Ages. The Father wrought ſo few Miracles, that he might leave to the Son this means of making himſelf known. The Son had the glory of pouring forth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, in a greater abundance than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thereby to ſupply the ſhame of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the true Reaſon why the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>the Spirit was not yet given, becauſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was not yet glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That from this Miracle one ought to infer theſe two Concluſions; The firſt is, That God was fully pacified by the Sacrifice
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46528:298"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, the Apoſtles conſtantly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Paſſion of our Saviour as a Sacrifice offer'd by him. The other is, That from that time forward Mankind was conſcerated to God as his Temple. Jeſus Chriſt in his prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death expreſſes himſelf much in the ſame manner as <hi>Solomon</hi> did at his Dedication of the firſt Temple, and Fire from Heaven falls down on his Sacrifice: Jeſus Chriſt conſecrates his Apoſtles to be the living Stones of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and cauſes the heavenly Flames to fall down upon them, as had formerly been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Dedication of the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The third is, That the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive a more glorious or magnificent Accompliſhment of the ancient Oracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the effuſion of the Holy Spirit at the time of the Meſſiah, than what we find rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> whereof the whole World may ſee the viſible Effects, in the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Chriſtian Religion: from whence one may rationally conclude, That Jeſus Chriſt muſt be acknowledged for the Meſſiah whom God had promiſed.</p>

                        <hi>That according to the Prophecies, the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt have called the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to the profeſſion of the Christian Religion.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WE have already ſeen what was the deſign of God, and that the diſtinction which he made of the <hi>Jews</hi> from other Nations, was only that the Meſſiah might by that means be the more certainly known, in whom all Mankind had a right, as being promiſed to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God renew'd the Idea of this truth in a very lively manner, when he aſſured <hi>Abraham,</hi> before he gave him the Law of Circumciſion, <hi>That in his Seed all Nations ſhould be bleſſed. Jacob</hi> enlightned by the Spirit of Prophecy on his Death-bed, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes this truth for granted, when he ſays that the Meſſiah, whom he calls <hi>Shiloh,</hi> was to be the expectation of the <hi>Gentiles, Gen.</hi> XLIX. Why doth he not ſay, That he was to be the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jews?</hi> but becauſe he ſuppoſeth that they were to be rejected, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called in their ſtead.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the Prophets until <hi>Malachi</hi> incluſively, a thouſand Declarations of this future Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Faith of the Meſſiah, and tho' the moſt part of the Idea's which the Prophets make uſe of, ſeem to be very figurative, deſcribing the Meſſiah as a Conquerour, who was to ſubdue the whole
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46528:299"/>World to his Dominion by the force of Arms; yet we find a great many others interwoven with them which only relate to the Profeſſion of the Religion of the Meſſiah, and which, not being capable of any other Senſe, ſufficiently determine the others, ſo as not to perplex the Reader with thoſe ſeeming Obſcurities. But Jeſus Chriſt very diſtinctly declares this in divers places, and above all in the XXIV. of S. <hi>Matthew, This Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be preached throughout all the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now nothing could ever be more exactly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled than theſe ancient Oracles have been; let the <hi>Jews</hi> cavil as long as they pleaſe about our application of many of the Prophecies of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to our Saviour; let them put a ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures which treat of this Subject, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were contemporary with Jeſus Chriſt ever did, and to the moſt of thoſe with whom the firſt Chriſtians, as <hi>Juſtin, Tertullian,</hi> and others, from time to time diſputed, yet at leaſt they cannot deny but that the thing has been exactly fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>It is clearer than the day, that nothing could be more exact: All Chriſtians, from one end of the World to another, worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſubjected them to the Moral part of the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> themſelves have learnt of the Chriſtians to acknowledge no other God but the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The multitude of falſe Gods which the World worſhipped, are vaniſhed from all places where Chriſtianity has been planted; and very few are left in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe which are already deſtroy'd, ſo that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46528:299"/>we muſt conſider the thing as already gone very far. In truth, while things continue thus, one may reaſonably maintain againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that our Jeſus and his Diſciples have taken away all the Glory which could be reſerved for that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah whom they expect. They muſt, if they be jealous for the Glory of him whom they look for, endeavour to make the World forſake the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to make way for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe Oracles which can have no place in that ſtate wherein the World is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>But tho' this Reflexion upon the exact accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Oracles concerning the Call of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Religion of the Meſſiah may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; yet I think my ſelf bound to make ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obſervations upon this Subject. In ſhort, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing deſerves to be conſidered in this Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the knowledge of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>I do not take notice at preſent that the perſon firſt employ'd in Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to whom Jeſus Chriſt had promiſed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of founding his Church amongſt the Nations, and who himſelf at firſt thought that the thing was unlawful, and who after a Viſion given him for that very purpoſe, obſerves the Jewiſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and obliges the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to do the ſame. Neither do I obſerve that the firſt who was called was <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Officer who reſided at <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi> where he became a Proſelyte. Behold here a man engaged to examine that, which he had a better opportunity to do than any one elſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the nature of his charge, whether what
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46528:300"/>the Souldiers had depoſed concerning the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſtealing away the Body of our Saviour, were true or no.</p>
                     <p>I am obliged to confine my ſelf to ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reflexions upon this matter. I conſider firſt the difficulty which was upon all accounts in this deſign of the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Succeſs which this Call of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> met with according to the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>To make us underſtand this difficulty better, we need only conſider 1. What were the Prejudices of the <hi>Jews,</hi> even thoſe who were become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. 2. What was the ſtate of the World at the time of Jeſus Chriſt. The Heathens enjoyed each their ſeveral Religions for a longer time than any Hiſtory could trace it. They attributed the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their States and Families to their Gods. 3. We muſt obſerve the nature of that preaching, by which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were converted: Its Subject was the ſtrangeſt thing in the World; if the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt had prov'd the Scandal of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who looked upon the Meſſiah as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Bleſſing, and the Croſs as an accurſed Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; it was look'd upon no otherwiſe than as an heap of Follies by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (who boaſted themſelves to be the wiſeſt men of the World) as well as by the other <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet after all this, one ſee's a prodigious Succeſs, and a ſurprizing Extent of this Call. Within a little time the World was fill'd with Chriſtians: S. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to thoſe that were in <hi>Aſia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Pontus;</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> to thoſe who were among the <hi>Parthians.</hi> There were not wanting ſome in the very Emperour's Court, even
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46528:300"/>that of <hi>Nero,</hi> who put S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to death in the Sixty ſeventh Year of our Lord.</p>
                     <p>One cannot attend to a Succeſs of this nature, without being extreamly ſurpriz'd; let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a dozen, or thereabouts, of poor Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, a dozen of unlearned Men coming out of <hi>Judea,</hi> who ſhould accuſe the whole World of Folly and Impiety; every one oppoſing them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were incenſed to ſee them go about to eſtabliſh the belief of the Croſs in the World, as a Doctrine which would explain the accompliſhment of the Promiſes of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah, of thoſe Promiſes wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> had filled all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and which had rendred them at this time doubly ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>When inſtead of perſecuting the Apoſtles, they hearken unto them; or even when in the midſt of Chains and Priſons they are examined, they declare that true Godlineſs conſiſts in knowing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, even the ſame Jeſus who was crucified in <hi>Judea,</hi> for whoſe Name's ſake they had been publickly ſcourged by order of the Council of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Thus we find S. <hi>Paul</hi> boaſting of his ſevere uſage.</p>
                     <p>If perſons queſtion them more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Actions of this Jeſus, they anſwer coldly, That the Son of God came down from Heaven; that he took upon him our Fleſh in the Womb of a Virgin; that when he was become Man, and yet an Infant, <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to kill him, to avoid which he was carried into <hi>Egypt;</hi> that after having lived thirty years obſcurely in a Carpenter's Shop, he was taken by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſcourged, mocked, crowned with Thorns, nailed to the Croſs, where
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46528:301"/>they gave him Vinegar to drink; that there he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> that he died, was buried, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the third day, as he had promiſed before his Death.</p>
                     <p>But what is it that this JESUS teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to thoſe that would follow him? His Apoſtles in his Name require all Men to renounce the Pleaſures of this Life, to abhor Polygamy and Fornication, and inſtead of revenging an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, to turn the other Cheek to him that ſmites us, and to leave our Cloak alſo with him who takes our Coat from us; to go two miles with him who conſtrains us to guide him one; to love our Enemies, and to wiſh well, and pray for thoſe that deſpitefully uſe us, and perſecute us.</p>
                     <p>But what Rewards will he give to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? The Apoſtles anſwer, That he promiſes nothing that is conſiderable in this Life, but an everlaſting Happineſs in the World to come.</p>
                     <p>It is viſible that nothing ſeems to be worſe contrived to gain credit than this Story. The weakneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is viſible, he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; what ground is here to believe that he was able to perform his Promiſes? The Service he preſcribes is very rough, the Reward he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is at a great diſtance, and moreover, it is ſuch as appears very doubtful to thoſe who are not furniſhed with ſtrong impreſſions of the immortality of the Soul, and of a life to come.</p>
                     <p>But on the other hand, the Apoſtles ſolidly demonſtrate that he is GOD, and not a meer
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46528:301"/>Man, that he can raiſe the Dead, and that he can perform his Promiſes. Tho' they do not ſay, Bring hither the Blind, the Lame, and the Deaf, and we will heal them in his Name; preſent your Dead to us, and we will raiſe them in the Name of that Jeſus who is born of <hi>Mary,</hi> of that Jeſus who died, and cried out on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> (For I acknowledge that this miraculous power which they had received, was only exerted upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions, which the Spirit of God made choice of.) Yet they did that which was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, for when blind men were brought to them, they ſaid, Ye blind, in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, recover your ſight; and in like manner to the Lepers, to poſſeſſed Perſons, to the ſick of the Palſey, to the Dead. Upon this all were converted, and the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſorts of People in the World, Wiſe men, Men of a middle ſort, and ſuch as are of a lower capacity; and ſeveral of theſe three Orders of Men made profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, as well amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Heathens.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">That the Chriſtian Religion is founded on Proofs of Fact, and that conſequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World ſo certain as the truth of it.</head>
                     <p>THis Reflexion ought to be made more than once, becauſe there is nothing ſo proper to eſtabliſh the truth of the Chriſtian Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all conteſt, or that will confound Atheiſts, prophane Perſons, and <hi>Jews,</hi> who endeavour to oppoſe it more effectually.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then, that the chief Articles on which the whole Chriſtian Religion is grounded, are confirm'd by proofs of Fact, that is, by Witneſſes whoſe Evidence cannot be queſtioned, without ſhaking all the certainty which we can have of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in this World, and without rejecting all the means whereby we can aſſure our ſelves of the knowledge which we enjoy.</p>
                     <p>Many particular Events which were perfectly Divine, happened at the Birth of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> the Forerunner of the Meſſiah; they were known throughout all the Hill Country of <hi>Judea;</hi> they happened to a Prieſt, that is, a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it was when he was employ'd in his publick Function in the Temple; they are ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Miracles which were known to the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> they are follow'd by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> a man who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46528:302"/>all <hi>Judea,</hi> who openly declares himſelf the Forerunner of the Meſſiah, and who hath a great number of Diſciples, who are diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe of our Saviour, who were ſpread throughout all <hi>Judea,</hi> and who continued after the death of our Saviour; theſe were Diſciples of a Man, who beſides all this, doth not keep up any correſpondence with our Saviour, and who at laſt falls by the hand of <hi>Herod</hi> for cenſuring his Inceſt and Luſts.</p>
                     <p>JESUS CHRIST is born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> under <hi>Augustus,</hi> a Fact of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were Witneſſes, and which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that Empire preſerv'd as long as they were in being.</p>
                     <p>That the Angels teſtified their Joy at his Birth, is a Fact which was confirm'd by the Shepherds of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> long before Jeſus Chriſt had any Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>That a new Star conducted the Wiſe men of the <hi>East</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> was an illuſtrious Fact, and of which <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Prieſts, and great men amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> were exactly informed; and the Apoſtles would have found it a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to impoſe this upon them, if the thing had not been diſtinctly known.</p>
                     <p>That the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt, and the arrival of the Wiſe men affrighted <hi>Herod,</hi> was a publick thing, confirmed by the murther of the Infants of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and reported to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> together with the death of <hi>Antipater;</hi> whereof <hi>Macrobius</hi> a Heathen, who was qualified for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch a Story, hath preſerved the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Neither can this Fact be called in queſtion,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46528:303"/>becauſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes no mention of it, ſince ſo famous a Heathen atteſts it. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having heard that amongſt the Infants which</hi> Herod <hi>the King of the</hi> Jews <hi>had cauſed to be kill'd in</hi> Syria, <hi>under two years of age, he had kill'd his own Son, ſaid that it was better to be</hi> Herod<hi>'s Hog than his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from thence, is a Fact with which the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day reproach our Saviour, as if he had learnt there the ſecret of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                     <p>That he confounded the Doctors at twelve years of Age, is a Fact of which the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jews</hi> were informed, becauſe it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one of thoſe three ſolemn Feaſts which brought up the whole Nation to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt was baptized by S. <hi>John,</hi> and that he received a moſt glorious teſtimony from him, is a Fact of which all thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> whom the Miniſtry of S. <hi>John</hi> had drawn to the River <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> were Witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt choſe for his Apoſtles men without Learning, and of the meaneſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he lived with them three years and an half, preaching his Doctrine, correcting the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> working Miracles, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come, are Facts of which the whole People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were Witneſſes, and all the <hi>Romans</hi> that were in <hi>Judea</hi> were fully inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them; yea, they were known to all the World. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not be ignorant of them, who came up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from all parts of the World to celebrate ten ſolemn Feaſts according to the Law, during the time in which theſe things
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46528:303"/>were acting, and from thence carried the report of them into ſeveral parts of the World where they were diſpers'd.</p>
                     <p>It is evident alſo that Jeſus Chriſt laboured to perſwade men that he was the promiſed Meſſiah; this was the moſt conſiderable Fact in the World to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which had relation to the moſt important point of their Religion, and touched them the neareſt: a Fact which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a time when all were in expectation of the Meſſiah, as appears by the conſultation of <hi>Herod,</hi> when the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were oppreſſed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> did moſt earneſtly ſigh for his appearance; a Fact confirm'd by publick Oracles, and known to the whole Nation, yea to the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for near Three hundred years.</p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, was crucified at the purſuit of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by the order of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> is a Fact of which the whole People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, becauſe it happened at the Feaſt of the Paſſover, that is, at a Solemnity where the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was aſſembled; it is a Fact which no Heathens ever went about to deny, they reproached the Chriſtians with it, who are ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſham'd of it, that according to the orders of the ſame Jeſus, they celebrate the memorial of it in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>That there was thick darkneſs over all the Land at the Crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt from the third hour till the ſixth, that is, from nine of the clock till twelve, according to our way of computing the time, was a Fact of that nature, that the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> might eaſily have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46528:304"/>the Apoſtles of this impoſture, if it had not been as confeſſed a truth as the darkneſs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before the departure of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed the third day, is a Fact atteſted by a great number of Witneſſes, the memorial whereof they celebrated every eighth day as long as they liv'd, by a conſtant Law, becauſe they conſidered this Reſurrection as the Seal of thoſe Truths which Jeſus Chriſt had taught them. 'Tis a Fact, the truth whereof they have maintained before Magiſtrates, before the People, in all parts of the World. 'Tis a Fact which they have publickly preached up, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Prohibitions which have been made: In ſhort, it is a Fact which they have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the midſt of the moſt cruel Torments, and even until Death.</p>
                     <p>That Jeſus Chriſt ſent down upon his Apoſtles the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Spirit, is a Fact of which all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a witneſs fifty days after the Feaſt of the Paſſover, when Jeſus Chriſt was crucified; it is as remarkable a Fact as ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; twelve Fiſhermen of <hi>Galilee,</hi> maintain in the face of the whole Jewiſh Nation, that the ſame Jeſus whom the whole Nation had demanded to be crucified but fifty days before, and who did actually ſuffer upon an infamous Croſs, is riſen from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven, after he had eaten and drunk with them, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſeveral times to them after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he had given them the power of ſpeaking all ſorts of Languages, and of healing all manner of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>That they ſpoke divers Languages is a Fact
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46528:304"/>moſt notorious, the truth whereof appears from the Converſion of the World, which was found to be fill'd with their Diſciples, but a few years after this Fact was done.</p>
                     <p>That they had the power of healing all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes as well as their Maſter, is a Fact the truth whereof is eſtabliſh'd upon indiſputable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, inſomuch as their Succeſſors received the ſame Gift by the laying on of their Hands. Two hundred years after <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions this Gift, as being at that time well known amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                     <p>That the Apoſtles, after they were rejected by the <hi>Jews,</hi> preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who alſo received it, is a Fact of which there are ſo many proofs in the World, that it cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>That the converted <hi>Jews</hi> ſtrongly oppoſed themſelves againſt the preaching of the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> pretending, as the <hi>Jews</hi> now do, that the Meſſiah with his Gifts and Graces was confin'd to their Nation, is a Fact ſo well atteſted, that it cannot be called in queſtion, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt diſpute, which gave occaſion to the firſt Council of the Apoſtles, and to the conteſts of S. <hi>Paul</hi> with thoſe of his own Nation.</p>
                     <p>That ſince that time the Apoſtles and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have maintained by their Writings and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and finally by their Martyrdom, that Jeſus was the Meſſiah; that they have conſtantly ſtood to this claim, alledging the Facts which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel propoſes, and maintaining that the matters there related were exact Accompliſhments of the Promiſes of God, and of the ancient Prophecies:
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46528:305"/>That all this is unqueſtionable, one needs only read their Sermons and Speeches ſet down by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and their Epiſtles; one needs only peruſe the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Hiſtory, and the Works of thoſe that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles, who followed their footſteps in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing the truth of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>That the Apoſtles diſcharged their followers from the Ceremonies which <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed, obliging them only to the Eſſentials of Morality: That they annul'd the Law which permitted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces without ſufficient cauſe, and Polygamy; theſe are things which none, who have read their Writings, or thoſe of their firſt Diſciples, can in the leaſt queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, That they foretold many things, as well as their Maſter; that they publiſhed their Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which they have extended to the end of the World, and the return of Jeſus from Heaven to judge the World; and that they have recorded the particulars of many conſiderable Events, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Chriſtians, which have happened from time to time; theſe are Facts as well known, and as inconteſtable, as any thing can be in the World of ſuch a nature. Whole Nations are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of it, differing Sects, Interpreters who have ſeveral Opinions concerning theſe Prophecies, the Conteſts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Oppoſition of Atheiſts, the Cavils of Hereticks, the Cruelty of Tyrants, all theſe concur to prove clearly that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans received theſe Prophecies from the Apoſtles, as well as the truth of them, ſince even theſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were foretold as well as the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:46528:305"/>
                     <p>Thus I have given you a view of the greateſt part of the moſt important Articles which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Chriſtian Religion; and I think that they are ſo ſolidly grounded upon proofs of Fact, that I can aſſert with reaſon, That no Facts in the World can be produced, ſo well eſtabliſhed as theſe are, which are the Fundamentals of our Religion.</p>
                     <p>What Facts are there which are atteſted by whole Nations, as the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt were? What Facts are there about which men were ſo careful to inform themſelves, as when a Man pretends to the Title of the Meſſiah? What thing can we ſuppoſe that requires a ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, becauſe of the difficulties it involves, than that of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt? for thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes of his Crucifixion, that is, who had ſeen him puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, the horrour of all his own People, and in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance forſaken of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak the truth, as there cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſtance of fanatical folly, than to attribute to twelve poor Fiſhermen, whoſe Maſter was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by publick order, and by an effect of the hatred of the whole Nation, I ſay, to attribute to them the deſign of perſwading that People, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, that this man was raiſed again from the dead, that he rules in Heaven; that he has beſtowed upon them the miraculous Gifts of ſpeaking all ſorts of Languages, and healing all manner of Diſeaſes; if this Jeſus had been never raiſed from the dead, nor had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſuch Gifts upon them, the mind of Man not being capable of ſo great folly: So we have
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46528:306"/>all the reaſon in the World to conclude, That ſince they have atteſted this Fact, and confirmed it by all the proofs which might convince thoſe, who tho' they were not prejudic'd, yet were aſtoniſh'd at the difficulty of the things themſelves, ſo that nothing can be more certain than Facts ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as we pretend that theſe actually were.</p>

                        <hi>That it cannot be queſtioned, whether the Books of the</hi> New Teſtament <hi>were written by the Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>BEfore we alledge thoſe Arguments which will invincibly confirm the truth of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I deſire the Reader to make theſe three or four Reflexions, which ſeem to be very important to our preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That we can ſcarcely conceive a more ſimple and ſtrong way of proving a Fact, than what we find in the Books here mention'd. The deſign of the four Evangeliſts, for inſtance, is to prove that Jeſus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah, and that in his Birth, his Life, his Doctrine, his Death, and Reſurrection, we meet with all the Characters which the Prophets attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Meſſiah. How do the Evangeliſts execute this their deſign? In the moſt proper way
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46528:306"/>imaginable to convince others, and moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their deſign. They ſimply relate the Facts; and Facts ſo clear, that if we do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of them, we cannot doubt that Jeſus is the Meſſiah. They relate the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of theſe Facts, as things that happened in the face of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I have ſhewed in the precedent <hi>Chapter:</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them as Facts for the moſt part owned by the <hi>Jews,</hi> from which the Malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted other Conſequences: They give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Judgment which the <hi>Jews</hi> made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miracles that he wrought on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, upon the Diſciples gathering the Ears of Corn, of the anſwer which the <hi>Jews</hi> made to <hi>Pilate, We have no other King but</hi> Ceſar.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That the Apoſtles ſuppoſing a general expectation of the Meſſiah, when Jeſus Chriſt appeared, ſhew that there was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great knowledge of the Prophecies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Meſſiah, and a great impoſſibility of applying thoſe Oracles to particular Facts, if the truth of thoſe Facts had not been beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Now we find very few Oracles of which they did not make an application to the Life and Actions of our Saviour. Wee'l ſuppoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to have been Men of great Abilities, and who had long ſtudied the Books of the Prophets, that they might tear out ſuch ſmall paſſages as they fancied might be applicable to Jeſus Chriſt: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cannot be denied, that it does not appear by their Writings that they had ſuch an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Prophecies, whence it might follow that they judged them to be applicable to Chriſt,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46528:307"/>by comparing them with the Facts which they relate. 2. That they had this knowledge in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the reſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who at this day apply the ſame Texts to the Meſſiah, if they are not conſtrained by their clearneſs to wreſt them ſome other way.</p>
                     <p>The third Reflexion is, That in the Relation of theſe Facts, they give us all the Marks of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſincerity; they repreſent indeed whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was for their Maſter's Glory; but they do as well relate thoſe things which ſeem to be ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his memory. They tell us of the Angels that aſſiſted at his Birth, and at his Death; but tell us withal, That he was tempted of the Devil, and in all appearance forſaken by God at his death. They tell us, That the multitudes were reſolved to take him by force, and make him their King, as acknowledging him for the Meſſiah; and they tell us, That the ſame multitude ſome time after demanded him to be crucified.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, That they repreſent very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the Judgments of the Synagogue againſt Jeſus: They repreſent him as excommunicated and crucified by them; they deſcribe the reports that were current among the <hi>Jews,</hi> That the Diſciples had taken away his Body out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; that the Souldiers had depoſed the ſame in the forms of Law before <hi>Pilate.</hi> From all which it appears that they were faithful Hiſtorians, and not at all prepoſſeſſed, and that they uſed no Invectives againſt the Authors of theſe falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, contenting themſelves to eſtabliſh the truth of the matter, by ſpecifying the places, the time, the witneſſes, and other circumſtances which are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46528:307"/>proper to eſtabliſh the truth of the Facts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
                     <p>Theſe four Reflexions being once ſuppoſed, I ſay, it is impoſſible to diſpute the truth of theſe Books, or to call their Authority in queſtion: To be convinc'd of which, one needs only conſider theſe two things; the firſt is, That the Apoſtles are the Authors of the Books which paſs under their Names; the other is, That their faithfulneſs is not to be ſuſpected by us.</p>
                     <p>The former of theſe is ſo univerſally received, that nothing will be certain in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if this be queſtioned.</p>
                     <p>The four Evangeliſts have publiſhed their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in populous Cities, where they have been conſtantly read every Lord's day in Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as S. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> aſſures us in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, which was writ about the middle of the ſecond Century.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles writ their Epiſtles to numerous Churches, to whom their hand, as well as the perſons by whom they ſent them, were well known. Can we inſtance in any Writing in the World that hath been preſerved with the like carefulneſs? Let the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us what they pleaſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the care and faithfulneſs of their Anceſtors to preſerve the Books of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> they can alledge nothing, but we can alledge the ſame in favour of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> They tells us that <hi>Moſes,</hi> under the penalty of a Curſe, had forbid the adding any thing thereto; and do not we read the ſame threatning in the laſt Book of the <hi>New Teſtament?</hi> The Philoſophers of each Sect, have nothing of this weight to alledge as an
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46528:308"/>Argument that the Books which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to their Maſters are really theirs; we find only a few men in every Age, who made it their buſineſs to ſtudy the Books of the Philoſophers, Phyſicians, and Lawyers; but ever ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles there have been Chriſtians who made it their buſineſs to peruſe and preſerve their Writings, as conſidering that they are the Fountains of Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>One may upon this occaſion take notice of two things which deſerve ſome attention: The one is, That the deſign of ſome Hereticks, as of <hi>Marcion</hi> for inſtance, to corrupt the Copies of the Writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which were found in the hands of thoſe of his Sect, is a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that they could not be corrupted. In ſhort, we find all the World oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this Corruption, and confuted them by the agreement of all the other Copies in the World which were exempt from this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The other is, That if there are ſome Books whoſe Authority was doubtful for ſome time, by thoſe who otherwiſe were accounted Orthodox, yet this cannot juſtly prejudice the truth of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened only to ſome few Epiſtles which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not to particular Churches, but to whole Nations. And indeed it is plain from common ſenſe, that when Writings are ſent to whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (as the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Jude</hi>) without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the Copy to particular men, that they may with more juſtice be ſuſpected, than thoſe whoſe hand was known by many, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46528:308"/>by thoſe to whom the Epiſtles were ſent.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, The account which the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church give us of the uncertainties of this nature, ſufficiently ſhew that they were very careful in examining theſe things; and when at any time ſome particular men did not uſe care e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in examining theſe Books, as it once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Church of <hi>Roſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Lib. VI. cap. 12.</note> where a Book which was falſly attributed to S. <hi>Peter</hi> was preſerved, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to have been his, the other Churches not conſenting to it, that Abuſe was ſoon remedied, the Writings aboliſhed, that there is ſcarce a weak remembrance left of them.</p>
                     <p>One ſee's that theſe Remarks are ſufficient to aſſure us that the Apoſtles are the Authors of thoſe. Books which bear their Names: And if this way of confirming a matter of this nature, be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good and ſolid, when we ſpeak of the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it muſt be infinitely ſtronger when it is applyed to the Writings of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Theſe Books were written to be read by perſons of the meaneſt Capacities, by Women, by Children as well as by Doctors: And they treat of matters of which the whole World hath reaſon to be informed. If ſome <hi>Jews</hi> ſuffer'd Martyrdom under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to preſerve the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> we have like examples, and as numerous, of thoſe who have done as much for the preſervation of the Books of the <hi>New Teſtameat.</hi> Laſtly, If the <hi>Jews</hi> have looked upon thoſe as Traitors and Apoſtates, who gave up thoſe Books to the fury of their Perſecutors, the Chriſtians have teſtified no leſs averſion for thoſe who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46528:309"/>the Books of the Apoſtles to the fury of Heathens, even to the ſubjecting of them to the utmoſt rigour of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, in the third Century and before.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That one cannot doubt of the faithfulneſs of the witneſs of the Apoſtles concerning thoſe Facts which they relate.</head>
                     <p>NEither is it more difficult to eſtabliſh this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Truth, That the faithfulneſs of the Apoſtles cannot be reaſonably queſtioned.</p>
                     <p>To be convinc'd of this, one needs only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Character of the Apoſtles, the Character of their Writings, of their Sermons, of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and of their Martyrdom, and laſt of all the Character of thoſe amongſt whom they wrote theſe things, and preached them to their death.</p>
                     <p>As to their Sermons; The Apoſtles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries with Jeſus Chriſt; they ſpoke of things which they had ſeen, and diſtinguiſhed them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from thoſe which they had learnt another way. They were honeſt men, ſimple and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Learning, very fit to bear witneſs in matters of Fact. They were Perſons that preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Love, and the ſtudy of Truth; they proteſted in the midſt of their Sufferings, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46528:309"/>they could not conceal the things which they had ſeen and heard; they are men without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs or ambition; they forſake all that they poſſeſs in the World; S. <hi>Matthew</hi> leaves his Houſe and Goods to follow Jeſus Chriſt. Their Epiſtles ſpeak nothing more than inſtances of Chriſtian Poverty, of the loſs of their Goods, and of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtances of their Charity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe witneſſes are ſufficiently numerous, they preach and write in ſeveral places, and yet they agree admirably in their relations of the ſame Facts; it appears they had ſuch lively and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct impreſſions, that they frequently make uſe of the very ſame words. The difference which is found in ſome part of their Books, is a manifeſt argument that nothing but the force of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made them agree in their Relations.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, how is it otherwiſe conceivable that four ſuch Authors as the Evangeliſts, ſhould agree about ſo many Opinions, ſo many Miracles, ſo many Prophecies, ſo many Diſputes, and in a word, about ſo many matters of Fact: ſhall we ſay that the ſecond took his Copy from the firſt, the third from the ſecond, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> This appears to be evidently falſe by peruſing of their works, and by the difference of their ſtile.</p>
                     <p>And certainly there appears ſo great ingenuity in their writings, that we cannot accuſe them of having had a deſign to deceive the world; they tell you plainly of the meanneſs of their condition and original; they ſincerely diſcover their own weakneſſes, their ambition, their vanity, their diſputes, their heats, their murmurings.

                     <p>They do not content themſelves with ſaying in general that ſome illuſtrious Facts have happened; but they punctually ſet down all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that it clearly appears their deſign was to have their writings examined, and that after an exact ſearch men might acquieſce in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which they draw from thence. For inſtance, they do not tell us that Jeſus Chriſt raiſed a great many from the dead, they only tell us of three, deſcribing the Circumſtances of their Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the time, the place, the age, the perſons, the aſſiſtants, and all theſe, with other particulars, which Impoſtors care not to enter upon, leſt they ſhould contradict themſelves, or be eaſily confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>I have already ſhewn, That the nature of the things themſelves which the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt have written, is ſuch as will not permit us to accuſe them of having had a deſign to impoſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46528:311"/>upon the world; they are Facts, and not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which are left upon Record; and Facts relating to the moſt important matter in the world, than which none was ever more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined; they are Facts which are linked ſo cloſely, and which have ſo ſtrict a dependance one upon the other, and ſo interwoven with the moſt publick Tranſactions, either in Civil or Religious Affairs, that it was impoſſible for them to form the deſign of ſuch an impoſture.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it is very remarkable, that theſe Facts were publickly known to the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, to the principal Miniſters of State, and of their Religion, and to the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> aſſembled ten ſeveral times at their ſolemn Feaſts; to the ſeveral Sects of the Jewiſh Religion, the <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens,</hi> who are attack'd, cenſured, and confuted in theſe Books.</p>
                     <p>One ought to conſider, after all, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at firſt preached and wrote in <hi>Judea,</hi> where were the witneſſes of thoſe Miracles which they related, the Impotent, the Blind, the Deaf, which Jeſus Chriſt had reſtored, the Dead whom he raiſed, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> whom he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, the <hi>Sadduces</hi> whom he confuted, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors who had heard him preach, the Towns wherein he had converſed moſt familiarly, the ſame People that followed him, the ſame Enemies that conſpired his death, the ſame Judges, and the ſame Authority which condemned him to death.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the relation he gives us of the Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Apologies which the Apoſtles made before Kings, before the great Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46528:312"/>in the midſt of their Synagogues, brings them in ſpeaking of the Facts contained in the Goſpel, as of matters publickly known and atteſted by a vaſt number of witneſſes. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of them in the Tenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the other Sacred Writers ſpake of them in the ſame manner in their Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>Here is a new Character which we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve: we find no Temporal Intereſt which obliged the Diſciples to adhere to Jeſus Chriſt; and we find yet leſs reaſon to ſuppoſe, if Jeſus Chriſt had not been raiſed from the dead, and they had not ſeen him after his death, that they ſhould have had any concern for his Glory; they would certainly have condemned and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiz'd him as an Impoſtor, who by means of ſome falſe Miracles, and an affected Holineſs, had abuſed them. Whereas indeed we find that they defended the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt with ſo much heat, and that with ſo conſtant a Teſtimony to his Reſurrection, that they expoſed themſelves to all manner of Reproaches, to all ſorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and moſt cruel Deaths, to confirm the belief of that Fact. They deſpiſe the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue, they contemn their publick Obloquies, they value not the hatred of their whole Nation. They preach this crucified Perſon in <hi>Judea,</hi> they preach him alſo in other Countries, that he might be equally adored by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> They leave their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to follow this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and after they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him three years, they depart from <hi>Judea</hi> to go and confound the Idolatry of the world, and within <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf to decry the Gods
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46528:312"/>they worſhipt, obliging them to acknowledge, him whom the men of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for their God; him, who had been the deteſtation of the <hi>Jews:</hi> him, whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate had given up to their Fury, in making him undergo the puniſhment appointed for Slaves.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, One ought to obſerve it as a thing of great weight in this whole Queſtion, That this Teſtimony of the Apoſtles which is ſo uniform, ſo ſolemn, ſo well confirmed by all manner of means, and ſealed with their deaths, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted or contradicted by any Hiſtorian of that time: There was nothing more eaſie, either for <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than to convince the World of the falſhood of the Facts related in the Goſpel; they had the Books of the Apoſtles in their hands, they were Maſters of the publick Records; it was a matter of general Concernment to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to oppoſe themſelves to an impoſture of ſo terrible a conſequence as the Hiſtory of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts was, if it had been entirely falſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it leſs the intereſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Sect, of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger tells us, that all ſorts of People joyned with them, tho' they were perſecuted with incredible violence. In the mean time we find no body that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Relation of the Apoſtles, nor any Author that has writ againſt Jeſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles. A long time after indeed there was a Book ſeen, call'd <hi>The Acts of</hi> Pilate, publiſhed by the Order of the Emperour <hi>Maximian,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to overthrow the truth of the Facts that are related in the Goſpels; but thoſe Acts
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46528:313"/>are contradicted by all the Heathen Hiſtorians yet remaining that were contemporay with the Apoſtles. Finally, a vaſt number of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were immediately convinced by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apoſtles, and a Belief in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath paſſed from <hi>Judea</hi> to the Ends of the World, according to the Predictions which God gave by the Miniſtry of the Prophets, and by the mouth of our Saviour.</p>

                     <p>WHat I have already alledged might be ſufficient to eſtabliſh the faithfulneſs of the Apoſtles, but for a fuller conviction of the Reader concerning ſo weighty a truth of our Religion, I ſhall ſuperadd ſome few more Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, It cannot be deny'd that the form of the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> is vaſtly different from thoſe which may be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Forgeries. When the four Evangeliſts had related the miraculous Birth of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> they next ſet down that of our Saviour Chriſt, with the Actions of his Life, until his Death, which does not comprehend above four or five years.</p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:46528:313"/>
                     <p>S. <hi>Luke</hi> writes the Hiſtory of the Apoſtles, and in particular that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and takes in on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpace of about Thirty years: Now let any one judge whether they who confine themſelves to ſo narrow limits in reſpect of time, place, and perſons, have any deſign to impoſe.</p>
                     <p>The remainder of theſe Books is compoſed of two ſorts of Writings, one Epiſtolary, and the other Prophetical: For the Prophetical parts, time muſt prove the truth of the Predictions which are contained in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as well as of thoſe which are found in ſome of the Epiſtles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
                     <p>As for the Epiſtles, beſides ſome Moral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they are almoſt all employ'd in deciding ſome queſtions, which the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Goſpel, and the aboliſhing of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law had raiſed in the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were converted to Chriſtianity. We know that of all Writings, Epiſtles are the moſt certain Monuments, and thoſe which men endeavour to forge leaſt.</p>
                     <p>After all, It is certain that the Sacred Writers have with great care ſet down the time in which every Event happened, as well according to the ſtile of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in pointing out to us their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts, as that of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by ſetting down the year of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and the Character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Character which hinders us from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing theſe Books as Forgeries, is this, That we cannot deny but that theſe Books are of a very particular nature; they contain ſeveral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oracles which were to be fulfilled in the ſame
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46528:314"/>Generation, as that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Croeſus,</hi> a continued Series of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of which all <hi>Judea</hi> was witneſs; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a great number of Sermons, preached upon ſeveral illuſtrious Occaſions in the Synagogues, in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and before thouſands of People in the Wilderneſs. Let any one judge whether it would be an eaſie thing to make theſe Writings to be received, if we ſhould ſuppoſe them to be lately forged.</p>
                     <p>This third Reflexion is alſo conſiderable: It is certain that the Goſpel was preached in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cities of the Empire, by the Apoſtles, and the Diſciples of Jeſus: The Hiſtory of the Apoſtles, and their Epiſtles themſelves make it evident, that there were numerous Churches at <hi>Rome, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Theſſalonica, Philippi, Epheſus, Antioch,</hi> and in ſeveral other famous places: It is alſo known that there were <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues in the ſame places; now if this be the Caſe, what poſſibility is there of ſuſpecting the leaſt impoſture in the Books of the Apoſtles, if we conſider how they were drawn up? The Diſciples of Chriſt did not only preach in the Synagogues the ſame things which they have put in writing, but they alſo engaged the <hi>Jews</hi> to examine them, becauſe they affirmed them with a conſtancy which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not but look upon as incredible obſtinacy: Firſt of all, That theſe were things beyond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and could not be doubted of. Secondly, That they had been long ſince foretold by the Prophets. Thirdly, That they were an exact accompliſhment of other Prophecies which had relation to the promiſed Meſſiah. Fourthly, That
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46528:314"/>ſeeing they could not queſtion the Facts contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, they ought to renounce Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, to receive Baptiſm and become Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo of great importance to obſerve fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have already done, that the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were penn'd, before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are only ſome of the works of S. <hi>John,</hi> which were writ after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> I have before obſerved that the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence order'd it ſo, that all the <hi>Jews</hi> for five and thirty years together, repairing thrice a year to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at their three ſolemn Feſtivals, might have greater opportunities to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the truth of the Facts contained in the Goſpels, and the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>To this Remark I ſhall now add two weighty Conſiderations; The one is, That the Chriſtians for ſome years ſubmitted themſelves to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and repaired with the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and by this means were engaged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Facts contained in the Goſpel. The other is, That after the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were diſpenſed with as to that Cuſtom, as well as the obſerving of all the other parts of the Ceremonial Law, which ſet the Chriſtians in a greater oppoſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo encreaſed the neceſſity of examining very ſcrupulouſly on both ſides, whatſoever was for or againſt them in thoſe matters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation leads us naturally to another, That it is abſolutely impoſſible that an impoſture of this nature ſhould not be diſcovered, when
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46528:315"/>there ariſeth a Difference between thoſe, who may be looked upon as the Authors of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and thoſe who after them endeavoured to gain credit to it. Now if we find that one Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt betrays him, without accuſing him of the leaſt Crime or Impoſture; if we have ſeen the Chriſtians at firſt united in the ſame Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conteſts and Diſputes between the Apoſtles and thoſe firſt Chriſtians, yet without calling thoſe Facts which are continued in the Goſpel, in queſtion by either ſide: S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of the Conteſts which happened betwixt him and S. <hi>Peter;</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates the heats between S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> upon very ſlight occaſions, he ſets down alſo the Diſpute which aroſe about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Alms to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: One ſee's that there aroſe a Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Apoſtles themſelves, about the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Goſpel; one ſee's afterwards the obſtinacy of ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who maintained the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſubmitting to Circumciſion, and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s oppoſition ſet down in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> We need no more to make it evident, that there could be no concert nor colluſion between them, to deceive or impoſe upon thoſe to whom they preached the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Let us go a little further; a Diſpute happens about a Capital Point of Chriſtian Religion, about the Reſurrection; inſomuch that S. <hi>Paul</hi> thinks himſelf obliged to write concerning it to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſo that there was a neceſſity of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46528:315"/>again. Now we find that S. <hi>Paul</hi> to confirm this Doctrine in general, chiefly makes uſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, which he proves by Arguments taken from the Fact it ſelf, that is, by witneſſes whom he produceth. Whereupon I make this conſiderable Reflexion, That in comparing this Diſpute of S. <hi>Paul</hi> with the Writings of the Evangeliſts, it clearly appears that they did not alledge all the proofs they might have done. None of them relates in particular the number of thoſe who ſaw Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee</hi> upon the holy Mountain; but S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had examined the faithfulneſs of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knew the witneſſes, ſpecifies the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and obſerves that many of them were yet alive, if perhaps any of them were already dead.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall add only two Conſiderations more, which prove that it was even impoſſible for the Apoſtles to impoſe upon the World on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The firſt is taken from their State and Condition. They are no great Lords, whoſe Power might terrifie any one from examining their Writings; or whoſe Reputation could not have been called in queſtion without danger: On the contrary, they were men of mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, employ'd in baſe Profeſſions, often caſt into Priſons, and from time to time oblig'd to appear before Magiſtrates for the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the ſame Facts which they publiſhed to the World. Let us conſider then whether it were an eaſie matter for S. <hi>Paul</hi> for inſtance, I ſay for this S. <hi>Paul,</hi> a maker of Tents, this S. <hi>Paul</hi> without Reputation, without Riches; this S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:46528:316"/>who was ſeized at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after divers Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this S. <hi>Paul</hi> who was ſent a Priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> and impriſoned there under the power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Magiſtrate, and who at laſt loſt his life by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s order to make thoſe blindly believe all he ſaid, who were at liberty to examine, whether all that <hi>Luke</hi> related as happening to him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Maltha,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> were indeed true, or only a framed Story.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing we ought to obſerve is, That not only the Books of the Apoſtles were publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read every Lord's day, by a conſtant Law, of which we have moſt authentick witneſſes, in the Writings of the Apoſtles themſelves, and in other ancient Books, which are ſtill extant; but alſo that they were all of them written, not in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which at that time was a dead Tongue; nor in <hi>Syriack,</hi> a Language ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a very few places; but in <hi>Greek,</hi> which at that time was the Language commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved throughout all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, was the Language into which the Divine Providence had cauſed the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to be tranſlated about three Ages before, that men might compare the ancient Oracles and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment together.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHat I have before ſet down to eſtabliſh the truth of thoſe Facts which ſerve for a Foundation to the Chriſtian Religion, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſufficient to anſwer the deſign which I formed in writing theſe Reflexions upon the Books of the Holy Scripture; and I believe I may with juſtice conclude, That as nothing is more unconteſtable than the truth of thoſe Books and of the Facts in them related; ſo there is nothing more certain than the Truth and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Chriſtian Religion. So that now I have only two things to do, with which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it will be neceſſary to conclude theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions: The one is, to ſhew the abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of conceiving any other accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ancient Oracles than what is ſet down in the Goſpel: The other is, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diviſions amongſt Chriſtians, which are a ſcandal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difficulty of the Myſteries which the Goſpel propoſes, which are as ſo many ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Blocks to them which hinder them from diſcerning thoſe Characters of Truth in the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46528:317"/>Goſpel, which by the fulfilling of the ancient Oracles, appear therein with ſo much luſtre. The former of theſe ſhall be the Subject of this, and the latter of the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>As the pulling down of the Scaffolds which were only ſet up to build a Palace, is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſign that the Building is finiſhed, ſo one may ſay, that the total defacing of the Model, which God had formed in the Law, that the Meſſiah at his coming might be certainly known, is an unanſwerable proof that he is already come. It is worth our pains to make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on this overthrow, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if the Meſſiah was yet to appear in the World, it would be impoſſible to know him, according to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which God had given of him before his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, whereas God had confined the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might be viſible to all the Poſterity of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> of whom one part, that is, the Off-ſpring of <hi>Cham,</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Japhet, Europe</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Shem</hi> the reſt of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are driven from that Country, and far from being reſtored to it after Seventy years, as they were by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> they have been for ever baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence, by a Decree of the Emperour <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who forbad them ſo much as to turn their eyes towards <hi>Judea,</hi> which was in the Year of Chriſt 135.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46528:318"/>vaſt expence deſigned to rebuild the ſplendid Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was formerly at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which after many and bloody Battels, being beſieged by</hi> Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>and afterwards by</hi> Titus, <hi>was at last taken with difficulty: he committed the care of haſtning the Buſineſs to</hi> Alypius <hi>of</hi> Antioch, <hi>who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been Pro-praefect of</hi> Britain. <hi>As therefore this</hi> Alypius <hi>was vigorouſly proſecuting the Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted by the Lieutenant of the Province, terrible Balls of Fire frequently breaking forth near the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, ſometimes burnt the Workmen, and made the place inacceſſible: Thus the deſign was laid aſide, The Element it ſelf beating them back on purpoſe.

                     <p>In the fourth place, The obſervation of ſome of their Laws was abſolutely forbidden, as being contrary to thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Thus they were not ſuffered to have many Wives.</p>
                     <p>Upon this overthrow many inconveniences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which it will be convenient to repreſent at one view.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They no longer know thoſe perſons who at the firſt Diviſion of the Land by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> were Owners of the different parts of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Families and Tribes are confounded; their Jubilee, which could not be kept but in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and which obliged them to ſtudy their Genealogies, having ceaſed long ſince.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Family of <hi>David</hi> is at this day utterly unknown.</p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:46528:318"/>
                     <p n="4">4. They have no more lawful Prieſts to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Primogeniture, to examine the Tokens of Virginity, tho' it appears, that according to God's deſign, theſe Laws were given on purpoſe to aſcertain the knowledge of the Meſſiah, and to be like Incloſures about this important Truth, in the compaſs of which it might be the better examined.</p>
                     <p>Certainly if the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtill in poſſeſſion of <hi>Judea,</hi> if they had their Kings of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> if they had their Prieſts, if they were aſſured of their Genealogies, if they ſtill enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the other neceſſary means for eſtabliſhing the certainty of their Deſcents, if their Temple had ſtill ſubſiſted in its former luſtre, and that the Sacrifices appointed by the Laws were ſtill offered there: The <hi>Jews</hi> might boldly anſwer that the <hi>Shiloh</hi> was not yet come, that is, they ought not to deſpair of ſeeing the Meſſiah born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and entring the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Then the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which determins 490 years for the term in which the Meſſiah was to appear, and be cut off by a violent Death and Puniſhment, would ſeem to be eluded.</p>
                     <p>But the term of the Meſſiah's coming is paſt, the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews</hi> is overturned, the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is deſtroyed 1600 years ſince; there are no more Genealogies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> they do not know their Tribes, much leſs their Families: How then can it be ſuppoſed that God ſhould be true in his Oracles (as we muſt acknowledge him to be) if they were never anſwered by the Event.</p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:46528:319"/>
                     <p>To ſpeak the truth, it is impoſſible to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arguments we have alledged to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah, and eſpecially thoſe Demonſtrations which the Apoſtles have given us, without acknowledging theſe two things:</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That it was very eaſie at the time of Jeſus Chriſt's appearing, to examine whether he who declared himſelf to be the Meſſiah, were ſo indeed; ſo it is abſolutely impoſſible to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, or know it, ſince the deſtruction of that Model, if we ſuppoſe that God at firſt framed it, for the determining of this queſtion, as we have no reaſon to doubt it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That the Chriſtians exactly followed this Divine Model, and being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth of the Facts which exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with it, and which anſwered it in all its parts, they had all the Reaſon imaginable to believe that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, if we conſider it well, we ſhall find that the whole Chriſtian Religion is nothing but a queſtion of Fact between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> But ſuch a queſtion as the <hi>Jews</hi> at preſent are not in a condition to maintain againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians agree in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the Meſſiah, or at leaſt about the moſt of them. According to theſe Characters the Meſſiah ought to be come: The Chriſtians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they may be found in Jeſus Chriſt, and they prove it by matter of Fact; wherefore we muſt conclude, That either theſe Characters at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Meſſiah, are not proper Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46528:319"/>to know him by, and ſo the Wiſdom of God will be eluded, and both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians equally deceived, in taking that for a Character of the Meſſiah which is not; or elſe that both the Meſſiah is certainly come, and and that He is no other than that Jeſus whom we worſhip.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to examine the double ſtumbling Block which the <hi>Jews</hi> pretend againſt the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>This Religion,</hi> ſay they, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Doctrines that are inconceivable, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Reaſon: For inſtance, that of the Trinity, that of the Incarnation and the Divinity of the Meſſiah.</hi> Theſe are the Doctrines which the <hi>Jews</hi> reject, as abſolutely incompatible with the Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which we have received from their hands.</p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:46528:320"/>
                     <p>But it is an eaſie matter to anſwer this Objection; 1. It is founded upon a total forgetfulneſs of the ſolidity of thoſe proofs of Fact, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Jeſus Chriſt is riſen from the dead, this is a Fact confirmed by ſeveral Witneſſes. It appears from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered death under <hi>Tiberius, Pontius Pilate</hi> being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Judea.</hi> It is known that <hi>Claudius</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Chriſtians from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 54. It is evident from <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he accuſed the Chriſtians of burning the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which himſelf was the Author of; the Chriſtians therefore made a conſiderable Body in the Capital City of the Empire, and this happened in the year of our Lord 64. <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſays the ſame thing. 2. It appears that <hi>Pliny,</hi> in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, takes notice of the manner of their Meetings. 3. <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> ſets down the Accuſation brought in againſt <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> and <hi>Domitilla,</hi> as againſt Atheiſts; which is the Title <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate gives to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> becauſe the Chriſtians rejected the worſhip of the Heathen Gods. 4. It appears by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> that this Book was writ in the Year of our Lord 63, and yet this Book ſuppoſes the Goſpel of S. <hi>Luke</hi> to have been written before it, and S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel takes it for granted, that ſome of the other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels were already publiſhed. 5. It appears from the Writings of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was then written, and the ſame may be gathered from the Books of S. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Polycarp;</hi> and S. <hi>Justin.</hi> Theſe Facts which are certain, are ſufficient to prove that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46528:320"/>immediately after the death of Jeſus Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and their Diſciples, as Eye witneſſes, maintained the truth of his Reſurrection. After this it may indeed be diſputed, by what Power he was raiſed, whether by a Divine Power, or by his own; but it is ridiculous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Fact by reaſonings drawn from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abſurdities which one may think to find in the Doctrines of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe Myſteries, as for inſtance, that of the Trinity, relates to the Divine Nature, which is incomprehenſible, ſo that it is no ſtrange thing if an Idea of it be propoſed to us, which not being diſtinctly known by us, may raiſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Perplexities in our Minds. If I would diſcourſe with one born blind, of the Sun, of its Light and Heat, and ſhould attribute to the Sun the Production of Light, and afterwards of Heat, he would find an infinite trouble not to imagine three Suns. It is known how the Philoſophers, who agreed about the Unity of the Soul, have notwithſtanding been obliged to attribute ſeveral Faculties to it, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People look upon as very different things, and which ſeem to oppoſe the Idea's of its Unity and Simplicity.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, The Chriſtians prove very ſolidly, that theſe Myſteries have been clearly propoſed by the Apoſtles, who received their light from Heaven as to theſe Truths, and ſo might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be believed upon their word, for the ſame reaſon that the Prophets of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were formerly believed.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, they aſſert that theſe Doctrines
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46528:321"/>were firſt expreſſed, tho' not ſo clearly, in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which is in the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the mortal Enemies of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>I add to theſe Remarks, that moſt of thoſe Facts whoſe truth is ſo invincibly eſtabliſhed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Doctrines; and that the whole frame of the Religion doth ſo neceſſarily require them, that we rob it of a conſiderable part of its Glory in queſtioning or conteſting any of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Reflexions may ſuffice in general to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this difficulty of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and for a more particular Satisfaction, we refer the Reader to thoſe Books which purpoſely treat of theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, deſiring him to obſerve carefully, that commonly the moſt difficult Objections of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks againſt theſe matters, do rather oppoſe the terms which are made uſe of, or the notions which men follow in ſpeaking of theſe truths, than the Propoſitions contained in the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At leaſt one may be aſſured, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are conſtrained to reſolve ſeveral parallel Objections, to which one can ſcarcely give a ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, without borrowing ſome Diſtinctions and Notions from the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Neither can the ſecond Objection of the <hi>Jews</hi> give us any more diſturbance. It is true that there have been Diviſions amongſt Chriſtians, and are ſtill to this day; What can we conclude thence? Can we reaſonably conclude that therefore the firſt Founders of Chriſtianity were doubtful concerning the truth of thoſe Facts which are the ſupport and foundation of it.</p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46528:321"/>
                     <p>On the contrary, upon an attentive Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one may find,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Hereſies have only ſerved to render the truth of theſe Facts more inconteſtable, by obliging thoſe that had conſider'd of them, to examine their certainty with more care and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. This is the Judgment one ought to make upon all thoſe Hereſies in the ſecond Age, about the truth of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, or about the truth of his Death: From thence men took occaſion to take notice of, and collect with great care all the Circumſtances that prove the truth of both theſe Facts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We find that the greateſt part of theſe Conteſts do not concern the truth of the Facts, but the ſeveral Conſequences drawn from them, the truth of thoſe Matters continuing ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute. This we find in the Diſpute raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the <hi>Millennium,</hi> the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Jeſus Chriſt being equally believed by both the diſputing Parties; but differently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, according to the temper of thoſe that conſider'd of them; ſome forming groſs and ſenſual Conceptions concerning them; others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more ſpiritual reliſh, which they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by ſtudying the Prophecies, and their true ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We find that this Diviſion which hath ſprung up amongſt Chriſtians, is one of the moſt ſolid proofs of the truth of the Books of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> If ſome Fools have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to decry ſome of them, or to falſifie ſome particular places, we ſee that both Parties unite to repel that violence, by producing their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46528:322"/>and beating back the Impoſtors with their united ſtrength. One ſee's that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> tho' a <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> writ Preſcriptions againſt Hereticks; and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> takes notice (without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome that were Orthodox) of their Crime in blotting out of their Copies, that Chriſt had wept.</p>
                     <p>It is known that the Diviſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Karaites</hi> and <hi>Thalmudiſts,</hi> the Jealouſie between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and the Diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> is a means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Scripture, and hindering its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, each Party being very vigilant to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Adverſaries from attempting any thing to its prejudice, in corrupting a Book which they conſider as common to them all.</p>
                     <p>I might obſerve many other advantages which accrew to the Truth from theſe Human Failings; but I will only inſtance in one, which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeem'd to me very conſiderable; and that is, That theſe Hereticks diſtinctly prove the truth of the Predictions of our Saviour. An impious perſon would have reaſon to accuſe our Oracles as falſe, if there had never been any Hereſies. But Truth triumphs in ſeeing ſo great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them, who the more they encreaſe, the more ſhe ſee's her ſelf confirm'd and eſtabliſhed. This is the Reaſon induced God to permit ſo great an increaſe in the firſt Ages, when the Truth, meeting with the greateſt Oppoſition by Perſecutions, ſtood in the greateſt need of ſenſible Characters, by which it might be known.</p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:46528:322"/>
                     <p>I conclude this Work with deſiring my Reader to conſider theſe Reflexions upon the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here propounded, with a ſerious attention, and to examine the Coherence and Indiſſoluble Connexion of them; and with prayer to God that it may pleaſe him to make them ſerviceable to advance the Glory of his Name, which is the only end I have propoſed to my ſelf in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them.</p>
